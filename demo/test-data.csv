Is it cloth related review or other categories?  Can we use these categories to cluster those review? 5. what kind of customer is likely to write a negative review?  6. what business value can we get from? "

It kind of mix between exams and projects, but here it is 100% projects. Hopefully, I can do it. As this subject is focusing on answering the questions. Having the right questions is quite challenging because right question can lead to how I going to find information, tools, and answers.

My biggest concern is definitely the coding. have never used Python so even though it's been said that this is not so important I still think being unfamiliar can very much slow down the process and makes Tutorials take a lot longer to complete. I feel generally comfortable with logic and can understand what code is doing if I read it so this should help, but I have a very busy schedule and sometimes small things that take people who know coding seconds will take my 5-10 minutes to fault find. I am genuinely excite about learning things in Python and without a doubt I will as long as I manage time and don't get overwhelmed. In terms of understanding the access to Jupyter Notebook/login in/refresh/set up of course I feel very comfortable.

I found it very frustrating when the classes were shuffled around i.e. the Tuesdays lecture became a Monday lecture after I had organised time off from work. But such is life and we just need to keep moving on.  My first challenge arose during the tutorial when I felt left behind.(I made the mistake of comparing myself to others when I should not have, as we all learn at our own speed). But all I needed was to go over the material at home which I did after the tutorial.  I would have loved the answers but unfortunately they were not posted. I overcame this challenge by getting to know the software program a little better, asking lots of questions to my friends in IT,  and by doing the tutorial and looking for cheat sheets for the command functions. Once I worked out that python/Jupyter is just like another language it made it easier to understand.   I am yet to complete Tutorial 1 as I need to go back over the lecture video (Part B). I am however feeling a lot more confident now that I  know I can complete it with the additional help I have received. If I get stuck going forward, I will wait until my Tutorial tomorrow night and ask more questions there as I am unable to attend the walk-in session tonight due to prior work commitments.

There are students from many different backgrounds studying this unit, which would be interesting because different backgrounds could bring different insights to similar problems in hand. We dealt with some beginner-level data curated by the lecturers on the students themselves.  Used some pretty straight-forward code to analyse the dataset. Discussed why some graphs more accurately describe a dataset than the others.  A very notable suggestion that Catarina gave us was that Analytics wasn't about making fancy graphs and complicated models but about what insights we could provide our company with our analysis so the business can benefit, which is exactly the reason why one doesn't have to be a technical genius to be good at data analytics. Data Cleaning takes long and it's up to us how we tackle discrepancies and that makes a huge difference on whether our analysis is good or great. The analysis of olympics.csv provided me with a much-needed refresher on python methods and most importantly Pandas as I had been working in R recently. The analysis of the data made me consciously think differently about tackling a problem in hand as Catarina had suggested and I would like to be able to keep doing that for larger problems in hand."

What impact will these challenges have on my goals and aspirations? I have no background in computer science so the learning curve might be steep for me  4. Self-critique – What should I improve and why? What other ideas can I use to improve myself? Improve Python programming skill 5. Potential solution – How can I improve in future? How do others make these improvements? Try to look at the provided codes again after class and find other resources e.g. Codecademy, DataQuest, DataCamp 6.

I feel as though I understand that the core components within this unit are the way in which questions are asked need to be direct, and specific to the problem at hand; this ties in well to the decision science concepts in my other unit. The other key component relates to the way that information is used; it's important that information is selected for relevancy and that it does reflect the outcome we are trying to achieve. I am reading a fair amount of supplementary information as well as keeping on top of my programming skills in order to excel within this unit. My goal is to finish with a high mark, and with a very good understanding of the course material and data analytics. I have notes in my notebook that I took during this week's lecture that I would like to add to this reflection this week. "

Due to studying part time and working part time i carefully arranged a timetable to have time to fit everything in. Teh entire reason for choosing a Tusday night 'studio' was the only time available- i actually choose this class over others i wanted to do becuase it was on the same time. I work during the lecture and don't have a chance to listen to it before running having questions. i feel diorganised now despite organising my timetable a while ago to compensate for work and study which has been completely disregarded by the university. Regarding learning Python: feeling a bit overwhelmed with learning how to use python: never coded before in my life... i think my Refelction journal theme for first submission at first will be my journey to learning python. At the moment i feel like learning python is like trying to learn a new language except i haven't been given the basics of grammar or pronoucaition. i've just typed a sentence i want to say into Google translate and i'm hoping i don't get a confused look back when i try to say it out loud.....

I thought I was doing okay after the lecture but after trying to implement the ideas and trying to come up with a solution for the problems presented during the workshop, I really felt I didn't understand my task. I feel as though the ideas are challenging, and my knowledge base is somewhat limited so I am going to try and watch some youtube tutorials on parsing data (which I found out, means to essentially translate it into another format to be used), JSON (which I believe in html and javascript based, which I am familiar with), and APIs in a little bit more detail. I'd like to watch how other people access APIs and treat them in a certain way within the notebook console in order to better understand what I am required to do. "

2020-03-06T02:08:49.596427,jepjum46,51,group-1,"Week One Thoughts:  Practice makes perfect? I find spending 4  to 6 hours on code practice a week is good to be in a comfortable position to understand the content and what the code is actually doing. I am finding the lectures in combination with the studio sessions very helpful at this point. Andrew is very good at explaining the concepts and when going into things in detail I understand and can follow along.  Feelings I feel overwhelmed and worried when a new concept is introduced - But once I worked on the tutorial questions I found the pieces coming together Challenge  I try to work out the problems and tutorial questions without assistance first - I found the question in week one around GDP and cleaning the data challenging - I think I brought some assumptions from previous coding in SQL around building the fields in a table you must reference them first but python takes care of it automatically (from my understanding) when filtering the data to five years and one country - I brought in the country field into the filter as I thought if it wasn't showing in the print output then I couldn't retrieve it as a field when using .LOC  I asked the tutorial group on Slack for assistance and Caterina came to the rescue - I was then able to complete the rest of the questions from week 1.  Self Critique  I brought assumptions in from other coding language - I need to just think like a clean slate and not think of other languages. But I do find Python similar to R, which I have used at work but in a basic way.  I'm unsure on the way things need to be presented/ what level of detail needs to be put in on reports and the presentation for assignments - I graduated undergrad 12 years ago and not sure of the level of detail for post grad Potential Solution  My coding assumption issue I believe has been learned the hard way - needing help to solve the solution was a great learning experience. I believe the more time I spend practicing and pulling apart the code the more confident I will get. For the presentation and level of detail I will buddy up with a few of my peers and see what level they are presenting at and failing that my my tutor Pat or Andrew may be able to guide me.

2020-03-06T02:38:49.557564,jepjum46,46,group-1,"Week Two Thoughts  having come through week one relatively unscathed I was pretty keen to learn new things.  Decision theory I felt from my background in Economics was similar to opportunity cost & marginal utility - expected utility is interesting as I suspect there could be a decreasing marginal utility to apply from making too many decisions - a measure could be the sentiment at time of having made another decision and record this over time and the number of decisions depending on the sentiment you might conclude that if a person was being more unsure if the decision they made was correct/ right they would be less likely to make more decisions in the future? something along those lines - This kept me up for a few hours thinking about it.  Retrieving API's was fun I enjoyed the challenge getting an image was relatively straight forward, unstructured Json files though is not fun and I will need to spend some time practicing for this - I could take the easy way out and work with numbers for the assessment but I think in the real world this will only set me back.  Feelings I'm confident after week 1 having understood the concepts and code so I have a good base for week 2.  Challenge  Unstructured Text is difficult but I think its more about using the regular expression function - I just think the tutorial on it in week 2 could have eased us in - I didn't get it and while there is the help tools like the online regex101 and the cheat guide I just don't know where to start. Self Critique I don't think there is anything to critique this week - I need to spend more time practicing the code  Potential Solution  with unstructured text I'm going to have a good crack at it and if I don't get anywhere I will ask for help at either studio or Slack.  Learning Opportunity Unstructured text."

I am aware that it's like that with anyhing new but it is a liitle hard when trying to learn things as you go which arent technically part of the course sylabus- on the plus side I really want to be good at code and manipulating data and the realistically this is the only way to get there. I didn't quite get the idea of regex initially but it's very interesting- and I can appreciate the skill and think acutally enjoy trying to figure out how to do it because its pure creative logic based problem solving! I feel like trying to learn HTML formatting might overload me at this stage so I kind of hope I can get by without really diving in to that- I've got enough to practice already.

2020-03-06T05:27:47.035196,zexgos72,62,group-1,"In my first week attending the IFN619 lecture, I was not expecting anything about the content since I didn't know what the content really was and how to work on Jupyter environment. After attending the class on Monday (24/02), I understood that I had to have python knowledge, what I though that I had. However, the content for the first week, in a first glance, was quite difficult for me because the explanation in the lecture was a little bit superficial. So, on the day after the class, I tried to learn by myself at home and I have struggled a little bit but I could understand better the whole process -about Jupyter environment and about the code that was introduced to us on Monday. I think the selfstudy for me works really well because I have been used to doing this since ever, e.g: I like to plan my study for the week/semester in the first week. On Wednesday (26/02) I attended the tutorial expecting that I would learn new stuff but I left the class with more questions than before. I know that I am really shy to ask questions personally, in class; so, I am really looking forward to attend the studio sessions on Tuesday morning as well. On Saturday (29/02) I studied per 10 hours this unit and now I am really confident about the content of the first week! "
2020-03-06T09:05:09.246,wiczub07,16,group-1,tutorial2 regex was too difficult to handle
2020-03-07T08:23:48.872475,hovrab95,4,group-1,"It was quite an unsettling feeling after my first week of study and attending both the studio and tutorial sessions, that maybe I may have bitten more than I could chew in choosing IFN619 as an elective this semester. I found myself facing 3 major hurdles with regards to the unit which was very scary and the hurdles were – Learning markup and python coding languages and understanding Jupyter notebook Understanding which functions to use and when to use them Learning the Data Analytics Cycle Thinking through my situation I immediately acknowledged the fact that I had to make a decision, either I swap data analytics for another elective or I embark on a very challenging learning journey which might just give me certain technical skills that would be of value in the labour industry. Understandably, all these hurdles made me feel very inadequate to perform well in this unit. I literally have no technical background. Even though I felt I was willing to learn, I still felt like I was being thrown into the deep blue sea. It was a dual feeling for me – on one hand, I felt scared while on the other hand, I felt challenged as a student whose sole purpose is to learn and acquire knowledge. I gradually became determined to achieve success in this unit. I decided to go for my second option - stick with the unit. I knew this was not going to be an easy journey. As a very hands-on learner, I made up my mind to start by trying out all the week 1 exercises prior to the week 2 studio class. Attempting the weekly tutorial exercises proved to be very challenging for the python and data-related tasks. I realised it was going to be a steep learning curve. Interestingly, working through the markup exercises was quite easy to do, especially after going through the markup reference document. I felt proud and encouraged as I had now acquired new skills and could understand the usage of certain codes! It was an exhilarating feeling. Nevertheless, this feeling didn’t last for long as I was off when it came to completing the foundational python exercises. I was not able to fully grasp the coding language, understand their usage in each scenario. In addition, I became aware that it was not going to be a simple matter of copying and pasting the codes; this is because when I did that and ran the codes, I kept on getting all sorts of errors which I was unable to decipher or fix. I felt my key challenge was primarily not knowing if I was doing the right thing, what I was doing wrong especially when I got the errors after running my codes, and also having no reference point for validating my results. The concept of variables and why they are needed was a foreign concept for me. Ultimately, I knew I had to invest more study time if I wanted to excel in this unit. In as much as I didn’t have an IT background, I realised that I wasn’t making the required effort to change the status quo. I have been digesting the reference materials and cheat sheets just to solve the tutorial tasks and not for the knowledge. This needed to change. I also observed that I wasn’t practising continuously nor going beyond the exercises given.  Going forward, I decided to take charge and control of my learning, doing all within my power not to compromise it. For me, this means getting the best resources and utilising them to the fullest capacity. As a kinaesthetic learner, I knew I had to not only read for understanding but also practise as much as I can to fully understand the concept.   I have now set out a plan to increase my knowledge and understanding of basic python programming language which is a major hurdle for my performance in data analytics. I intend to fully utilize all the resources at my disposal to build up my knowledge about data analytics as there is always new knowledge or insight to be gained. Once I scale through this hurdle, I believe I will be able to fully grasp the principles behind data analytics that this unit has to offer especially as it applies to my career goals."

Have managed to get set up with new laptop and attempt to complete some of the remaining tutorial questions that I found quite difficult.

Anyway. Problem solved and was able to get to next simple step. But took old-fashioned biro-notes during class to help. Tutorial:  Reported to tutor that feeling a little better about things and concentrated efforts on getting this (setting up self as a user within GoingOk) part of my work up to date.Feeling generally ok that should be able to catchup. Week 2: cannot remove content - edit or add properly, have addressed with a bunch of questions to help rectify my issues. Deciding not to worry if these things seem to remain unchanged. Lots of personal changes within going on outside uni as much as at uni. At uni, across all units, I am being faced with new and sudden changes in the way I carry out my work (old-fashioned notetaking to electronic methods). Requires major changes in some areas. Something I am not foreign to, by a long shot, throughout my entire life and have had no option to do otherwise. Have still a few more organisational tasks to complete - such as improving the way I keep my jupyter files nice and tidy for starters. I'm sure I will get better at that :)"
2020-03-08T00:36:34.322545,cuzdus72,47,group-1,"So I'm writing this a little late, end of week 2, but this is my reflection for week 1. So this was my first lecture back at uni so a little nervous but also excited to get underway. So first week a lot of my classes kind of blended into one, i found it hard to distenguish between the four of them. One thing that stood out was the focus of the write question, always starting with the right question. Also the focus on being careful with incomplete data sets. There was a lot of code in there and I'm not sure how well I kept up, it was nice to hear that code will not be the focus of the classes, and that you can do well without it, andc that getting the right question is more important cause I think that is going to have to be my focus because just looking at the code i don't its going to be my strength. But also sometimes I struggle with questions, i don't know how it's going to work, cause if I have parameters its not so bad, but if they just say ask a question I'll be really nervous, everytime I thought of one I got really nervous because when I thought about it more they all just seemed so simple. I wonder if it's one of those things that the simpler the better but then I worry that that isn't the case and that if it's too simple then it's like well why did you ask that question. Yeah I think coming out of week 1 my main worry was around asking the right question and hoping that that is something that we look at more deeply later. but having said that. it's week one so I don't feel super stressed I feel like there will be time."
2020-03-08T00:37:06.954248,cuzdus72,28,group-1,"I'm a little bit lost on i all at the moment if I'm honest. This week I decided to drop a subject because I just wasn't having a good time with it all and it didn't make much sense for me to punish myself through full time for one semester and then take it easier with two subjects for the next three semesters, so trying to distrubute out the workload, especially as this is my first semester back and I'm trying to get back in the swing of it. So that was a big decision for this week, not entirely sure the subject that will be dropped but I have a feeling it is going to be MXN500, which is good because I was probably going to struggle with some of the math components of that so it is good to be able to take some more time with that. One of the reasons for it as well was because between it, this subject and 555 I'm learning three new languages I've not touched before, all of which similiar enough to be confusing, different enough not to work if you mix them up. So I'm hoping that it will all clear up a bit now that MXN500 is out of the picture. So lecture this week was alright, I felt like I kept up relatively well throughout it, I'm still not sure I know exactly what an API is but I felt like I had an alright grasp of it, and then the tute came along and I was just lost. Part of it I feel is the inconsistencies of API's and our tutor did say that, that they are difficult to navigate because they differ so much from one another, but it was quiet disheartening, I had a piece of code going that was opening up some API's but not the majority of them and I had no idea why, the tutor was out and about helping people that were further behind than me so I felt bad asking for help but at the same time I needed it pretty bad, as did a lot of us. And then there was the Regex section of the tute questions and that is where I was just gone, I was confused because I thought it was a function in python which i think it is but there is a website that you can use to do stuff but I'm not sure what cause I just sat in front of it really confused. I was there with Sakitha, neither of us, able to do anything. And this was like the second question, there was still questions after it, questions i still haven't gotten to yet, I've been focussing on my 555 work cause I am actually quite enjoying it, and it makes me feel like I'm being productive but I am letting my other subjects slide because of it. My other issue, and hopefully now that the other subject has been dropped is that I feel like the start of my week i can't do anything, I'm flat out busy either working, going to lectures, soccer or catching up on lectures I've missed because of soccer, the weekend is where I can get a lot of my work done but the problem is two fold, a lot of work stockpiles up to the weekend, and two i spend the first half of the week very stressed because I'm not doing any work. But on the plus side, I was able to log into the slack today which allowed me to use this service which has me feeling much better about progress and also on the slack someone had put up some videos about regex and I think I'm gonna spend some time listening to those and getting an idea of what's happening there. I think that's all for now."
2020-03-08T00:38:18.992209,cabguv94,0,group-1,"Week 1 - With nearly 20 years accounting experience, I was looking forward to acquiring some new skills to gain a competitive edge at work.  There has been a great deal of focus on data analytics at many of the conferences/forums that I have been attending and I work with large data sets to identify issues so this looks like the next logical step.  But then, I attended my first lecture and discovered that completing this course was going to be a very steep learning curve for me.  After using Microsoft Excel for nearly 20 years to collate, clean and present my data, I would now have to learn a new program called Jupyter and Python coding!  I managed to follow the lecturer through the first lecture and wondered whether Jupyter was like Excel and Python was like VBA which I had some experience with.  It was in my first tutorial that I realised how much I was out of my depth.  I couldn't load files into Jupyter nor could I answer the basic python coding questions.  I sat there in silence wondering if I had made a mistake and whether this was the right course for me.  It was quite an emotional moment for me because it would mean that I have given up.  It wasn't in my nature to give up.  At that moment, the girl beside me tapped me on the shoulder and asked me if I needed help.  She was in her second year and had prior IT experience.  She showed me how to load the files and recommended a couple of YouTube videos on basic python coding.  My determination kicked in at that moment.  We started working on the example and I was able to follow, based on the codes we covered in the lecture.  I was told over and over again that understanding the codes wasn't critical, we could just as easily find one that suits our needs online and use it. Thoughts: I have never done any coding and I couldn't understand why the codes were written the way they were.  They didn't appear to follow any logic.  I was told to just google the code and copy it across.  This made be very uncomfortable.  How does one apply it to a new scenario without understanding what the code is doing?  I was completely out of my depth.  I wasn't expecting the whole course to be about coding.  Why didn't the university set a coding pre-requisite for this course? Feelings: I am really worried.  I am so lost, where do I begin?  How will I find the time to learn python?   Challenge: The biggest hurdle for me right now is coding.  I had no experience in coding.  Will the online videos and tutorials help me get to where I needed to go?   Self-critique: I found that I was giving up.  I wondered whether it was worth the effort and time away from my young family.  I have never given up before, how could I justify withdrawing from the unit/course?  Could I return in a few years to try it again? Potential solution:  The only solution I could see was to watch the videos and tutorials online and try working through the examples on my own.  I told myself that I would give it a chance and see how I felt after a couple of weeks. Learning opportunity: I still want to acquire data analytics skills for my future career.  I plan to persist.  I will give it a couple more weeks to see if I can understand the content."
2020-03-08T01:06:18.110493,cabguv94,3,group-1,"Week 2 - I started my week watching as many videos and online tutorials as possible about python coding.  Some made sense, others were far too advanced.  The basic python questions in the tutorial were difficult to complete for me but with the help of the internet, I managed to answer them.  I'm not sure if they are correct because we didn't receive the answers.  The lecture was easy to follow and introduced new concepts (use of textual data).  The lecturer made it sound so easy but when we started working through the examples in the tutorial, I was lost.  The tutor helped me retrieve the picture in the first question but as I struggled with the second one.  It didn't appear to follow the lecture material.  This was exactly what I was afraid of - not understanding the codes and then struggling to apply them to another example.  How in the world was I going to complete the assignment if I couldn't even complete the basic tutorial questions?  I got stuck on the second tutorial question and with the notebook, you cannot move forward unless you get the prior code correct.  I did ask the tutor but he wasn't able to help.  I could see a few people were in the same boat.  Some of these people left, others like myself stayed but I couldn't help wondering that it was a waste of my precious time sitting there unable to move forward. Thoughts: I am still struggling with python coding.  I do not feel I am getting any value out of this unit.  More importantly, I do not know how I can use this to improve the analytics we currently do at work.  With all the systems currently available in the analytics space, is coding really that important?  When will we learn about the 'analytics' part of the course?   Feelings: I am feeling pretty deflated.  I am questioning my ability to learn new skills.  Perhaps I am just not cut out for this? Challenge: I still haven't got the skills that I need to complete the coding.  Unless I acquire them very soon, I will not be in a position to complete the assignment.   Self-critique: I appear to be giving up.  I can't see the benefit of continuing the unit/course.  I could persist for another week.  Perhaps over time, I will learn to understand python coding.       Potential solution: Find some spare time to go over the lectures and tutorial questions again.  I made up a sheet of all the codes we have used so far.  It seemed to help. Learning opportunity: With my excel skills and my experience in the analysis of data for work, I think I could really benefit from this challenge.  I surprised myself this week by understanding the basics of coding but I still have a long way to go."

2020-03-08T06:39:18.160471,fivbax85,67,group-1,"Honestly, I was quite lost last week (week 1), but, I am feeling much better after having some self-practice. My first challenge is back to study after a long time and working at the same time as I am studying; second is being new to Python! But, By reviewing the lecture and taking some notes, I believe that I will be back to my previous study style. I found out that I should have extra practice each time after the lecture and interactive session otherwise, it is going to be a nightmare to be at the tutorial. Asking and thinking about a good question is going to be my main focus and also the rest of Data Analytics cycle."
2020-03-08T09:05:34.895460,zedvaz17,24,group-1,"and so the frustration of python continues... i thought i was making progress and then bam, you're knocked on your ass by something you don't understand and therefore can't fix.  I decided to run through the coding lectures as suggested by tutuor- i'm struggling with the coding part of the class...alot.  i got all the way through the first lecture and was beginning to feel good about things - i was even able to fix my own mistakes, just general formatting and spelling errors and now i'm stuck again... i was attempting the tutuorial for week 1 and have been unable to load the agriculture data... for some reason i keep getting some error about now how the file doesn't exist even though i can see it and look at it and i've traced the right path location... i don't undestand the error! i've been able to load other files just not this one. i even tried going to the website and downloading it again and importing it again but nothing is working... it's hard to make progess when you can't even download a file... just when i was getting into the swing of things as well...grrr.  Is there something wrong with the dataset- is that the excercise actually opening it and checking the data perhaps?  why is there a different import method than previously?  maybe it's time to call it a night and post on slack. Slack isn't really my favourite method of communicating- you can already see it's a bit of a mess. i prefer the face to face stuff but i haven't enjoyed much of this class to date so will just keep trudging on."

2020-03-08T12:03:08.696944,bavsig30,39,group-1,"Week1 Lecture This is my first lecture session for IFN619 Data Analytics for Strategic Decision Makers. I knew this class would be fun from reading the unit detail because it does not only revolve around technical and hard skills  but it fosters student to critically think about what causes problem in business perspective and organisation and utilise data to solve those problems. I was introduced the Jupiter Notebook for the first time. The platform looks user-friendly but I might need quite a few weeks to get used to it.  We were guided through the example of codes and markdown function in Jupyter, and as a non-background student I find the codes quite complex. Dr. Catrina went quite fast with the code cells but later she told us not to worry too much because she was just getting us used to the Jupyter environment. I revised the lecture session again when the record came out but the sound quality is not the finest. I created a new notebook just to practice writing codes along and I felt more confident. I found that Python is very useful compared to Excel or other programs that users have to do it quite manually. The challenge I encountered is section [6] “some exercises to consolidate your knowledge” this was my first week in my life doing Python and I had no idea what code to write to bring out the answers I want for Olympic questions. I felt worried when I think other classmates would find this section quite easy for them. Week1 Tutorial The first tutorial was fun. We practiced markdown through markdown reference it was fun and simple.  It was more difficult with overview of analytics process when we did agricultural data. By the time I had my first tutorial session in this unit I already had MXN500 which we use R so I got little confused with the syntax of both programs. I learned a very basic solution that is when code cells get error it is because I have not run every cell that comes before it. I do not like how every code I write on Jupyter Notebook is automatically saved because it overwrites the original file. When I want to revise from the start, I couldn’t (and the tutor has not uploaded the original notebook yet) We could not finish the practice in the class so I continued doing it at home. When my code gets error I searched Google for solutions but sometimes it did not work and it took a lot of time. It could be because the codes and solutions are very various on the Internet. The problem with data is there is a lot of missing information (NaN), in MXN500 we do have missing data too and it is simple when we write na.rm to remove the missing Not Available data but in Python I have not been able to do so. I tried searching google and try function ‘drop’ but it did not work. I would ask my tutor later. The challenge with computer languages is even when I find solutions on Internet that people have posted sometimes it does not work and I have no idea why."
2020-03-08T23:09:10.825936,jevmuc72,58,group-1,"Wk1 1. Thoughts – What do I notice about my situation? What does it mean for me? Why is it significant? As a mature students who goes back to uni after working full-time for a few years, I juggle uni and heavy duty work, which means I have other responsibilities and I have less time to study. This means that I have to be more efficient and effective in terms of studying, otherwise I can't do a good job in either work or uni.   2. Feelings – How do I feel about this? Why do I feel this way? What do these feelings say about me as a learner? After 6 years in business school and nearly 2 years working as an accountant, I am beyond excited yet nervous to study this unit. I have to admit that sometimes I don't like change, however, I found this unit very interesting and I love to learn new skills. 3. Challenge – What problems exist in my current situation? How do they challenge me? What impact will these challenges have on my goals and aspirations? The coding part is a big challenge for me for sure. As a person who spend my whole academic life in business school, even loading the data into the environment is a difficult task for me let alone lines of codes. However, I think this is great opportunity to push myself to learn Python, which a programming language I have been wanted to learn but never had the time to.   4. Self-critique – What should I improve and why? What other ideas can I use to improve myself? Unlike my old uni life in business school, when I was just relying on recordings, I need to attend lectures and tutorials. 5. Potential solution – How can I improve in future? How do others make these improvements? Be a active leaner rather than a passive one. Go through tutorial materials before attending the tutorial.  6. Learning opportunity – How do I want to change in future? How can I learn from other perspectives in future? What do I plan to do about it? In which direction do I head next? I want to get some basic Python knowledge. I am planning on watching Python tutorials on Youtube. "

So instead of attending the lecture I'm getting myself organised by creating a calendar with all my assessment due and draft dates in it. It does have me feeling similar to how I was on the weekend of, I distract myself from work I don't want to do with work that is more preferable but maybe not as urgent, maybe even writing this journal is an example of that, I feel maybe I should be working through my tute problems for this subject, something I struggled with quite a bit, getting use to the langauge, but I can make myself still feel good by still doing work that just maybe isn't as urgent. Makes me feel worried that the work I'm putting off is going to build up, the more I ignore it the more I won't want to do it and that just builds and builds."

2020-03-10T02:53:14.057457,hozfut91,19,group-1,"Week 2 introduced us to working with APIs. We used the xkcd comics API to demonstrate how we fetch the JSON data from an API and make use of it in our way. This was one step forward in data cleaning as the API data is never human-friendly to read.  The data is usually in a dictionary format so it goes with key-value pairs. Exploring the xkcd API, what clicked my mind to take it further was to compile all the comics the creator ever published and publish them into a neat PDF. I would work on this over the rest of the week. Next up was university and the Reviews data. The Reviews data was quite helpful in making use of the different structure of its data as we had to use Regular expressions to fetch certain parts of the data, I will look more into this as well over the week as the example shown in the Studio wasn't enough for me to fully grasp it. Going through this dataset, I think we explored a lot of concepts and made use of the nuanced information to make our output look better. The final task of using the sentiment of the review to colour code the title of the review was pretty cool. I couldn't fully understand it during the class but in my review session, I should be able to take it at my own pace and make sense of the code. During the tutorial session, we were asked to explore various APIs which were free to use without any API key. I chose this time to get back to the xkcd dataset, trying to explore ways in which I could export this data into a PDF. In my findings, I realised python doesn't have many libraries which can output data into a new PDF very well (idea for a new project to work on perhaps?). The next best thing would be to fetch all the data offline and then export that into a PDF - quite tedious. Further thinking about this problem I thought maybe I could export it into an HTML (easy styling) and then convert that into a PDF which made much more sense. I was successful in exporting my data into an HTML with some styling, which was pretty cool. I'll continue exploring this idea whenever I find the time. Through this, I didn't get to work on the rest of the task sheet but looking back at it, I feel distressed looking at tasks in my hand. I might be falling behind. I'll need to come back to this task sheet again next week along with the one from the next week. "

The audio was breaking in the beginning of the lecture but it was better than week1. The function “Json” was introduced ( as a non-background student) I would say it was done in quite a fast pace. After lecture I searched on Google and find different approach and code to which people parse data form Json into Python. The code looks even more complicated and I am not certain if I will be able to remember it but all the syntax looks logical and makes sense eg. request, response. I enjoyed this session very much as it was very practical. We practiced Australian universities data together in lecture class and then I tried ‘New Zealand’ and ‘Thailand’ as well. I wonder if this code and its pattern can be applied to every set of data from API, however, I tried it with different data later and found out that it worked but one problem I encountered was ‘HTML’ is not defined. I still find it very challenging to understand Python syntax as it is more complex than R for me. Assignments were introduced and I feel worried because it seems like I still do not catch up with the first two weeks of Python sessions but the professor said that all of this will make sense and fall into place after a few weeks. week2 Tutorial In terms of learning opportunity, as we have quite a large number of students in tutorial class and due to time constraints the tutor cannot go around and help every individual in the class and I feel lost sometimes. I would prefer that we solve and go through the exercise together on the screen but I also understand that individual learning is important for improvement and academic growth but for me it is quite difficult to find solutions to technical errors especially when I have never coded before.  The challenge is when I try the same set of codes (only change variables) to different data set, some attributes do not exist for example, ‘list’ object has no attribute ‘get’ python. and I have to wait for the next tutorial session to ask the tutor for the solutions (I already googled but I still could not get it)"

The Decision theory introduction and how one uses in a real-world scenario, the example given and discussed during the lecture gave better insight. Some topics on unstructured data and formates are questions to take home this week?"
2020-03-11T02:50:42.314598,tosnif47,40,group-1,"Week 2 has been a good learning experience in pulling the data from different sources. I learnt about the parsing using Regex, though it took bit time. I also learnt about the visualization and representation of the data. It also helped me in converting the data in to Json format so that it can be further used for different analytics purposes.  Main point was to get the sense of analytics and asking the right questions to understand the analysis of data.  Feelings – How do I feel about this? Why do I feel this way? What do these feelings say about me as a learner? As a learner, it has triggered spark in me to understand the data analytics field and I have subscribed to two other units to develop skills in data scientist. I feel I have taken the right first step, and I will have to work hard to ace in this field.  Overall, learning is a continous process and I will improve day by day in data analytics field. Challenge – What problems exist in my current situation? How do they challenge me? What impact will these challenges have on my goals and aspirations? Currently, I have to learn and code so a challenge as I have to manage other units as well. The impact is if I do not learn to code then I will not be able to accomplish my assignments. Self-critique – What should I improve and why? What other ideas can I use to improve myself? I have to learn Python and analysis of data using Python. Potential solution – How can I improve in future? How do others make these improvements? I am going through online courses to learn Python and techniques to fetch, analyse data. Learning opportunity – How do I want to change in future? How can I learn from other perspectives in future? What do I plan to do about it? In which direction do I head next? Learning opporunity is huge and I have to speed my learning process to keep up to date with my python skills. I think I wil have to go through topics that are going to be covered in lectures so that I understand properly during the lecture."

This is mainly because I had experiences of using Python and Jupyerlab for data analysis before. However, I still learned several new technologies, such as getting data from API. Most of the data I used before downloaded, but I think getting the data from the API will be more convenient to help me to solve the practical problems. In addition, I learned how to structure data. The data structure is quite important in data analysis as it could be difficult to get structured data in real-life problems. The simple method of data structuring was introduced in the studio, and I also practiced in the tutorial. "

So I went to the tutorial class and also stayed a long time to be able to do each exercise that was presented even with the help of the tutor. So I studied further at home, tested each line of code and saw what each line showed and what happened when I changed one thing or another. This helped me a lot.

My codes may have several redundancies, which makes them less readable, but I don't know how to modify it. I will discuss with tutors and peers whether there is a simpler way to write this part of code.In addition, I found that I am not very familiar with libraries such as Pandas, as I often need to check some basic usage when writing, which spent me a lot of time.

It's really disheartening, I compare it to IFN555, at the start of 619 they said, the tech side of this isn't important that you wont be marked on that and I thought that sounded great and I was a little nervous about my 555 class cause it was the ooposuite and code isn't something I've done before so I was super excited for 619 and very nervous about 555, now its swapped, its the complete opposite, I love my 555 class and dread 619, the reason being any problem I need to do in 555 i know theyve taught us the code for, my knowledge of the code has been built from the ground up, any errors i come across I have been taught to solve, in 619 we are thrown in the deep end and I don't know if my error is because of syntax, my data, the funcion i'm trying to use for the first time, so it's really hard to problem solve what is going on because there are too many things it could be. Having said that, this week was the first week my brain started to click in some of the similarities between the codes, functions have always looked the same but they feel similar now this week which was cool. Also I shot off a draft of like 7 of the questions for part A and i feel fairly confident about them, which improved my mood dramatically, problem is, my mood on this class is based heavily upon that, if I don't do well then I think I'll return to being disheartened, but I'm excited to put some work in over the weekend and really get cracking on figuring it out."

The learning curve has been steep, but I am feeling that it will pave the way towards a rewarding and mentally healthy pathway professionally, interpesonally and also on personal levels. Had some definite mishaps throughout the week, but some small successes that are helping me to feel that good progress is taking place, including not being too hard on myself in a number of areas. On one front I am enjoying the new learning journey. While on the flip side there has been a great deal of stress associated to everything going on. The main thing is that I am starting (and only just starting) to feel a little bit of progress with the content in the right direction, rather than tackling hurdles that were nothing more than stress-based error making (extreme anxiety perhaps). Overall, things are feeling better, but I would not say great at this point as I have still felt quite disappointed with myself at this stage.

Being a working mum and juggling so many things I decided to cut back on hours at work. The unfortunate thing is that all the stress leading up to this decision caused me to get run down and as a result  I got sick (viral infection and no energy what so ever do anything).

HOWEVER, knowing that things move very fast at University at a Masters level, I contacted everyone I know in IFN619 and asked them what I have missed out on and also informed my tutor about my illness. I can now email my tutor for help. This was a big reassurance for me as I was nearly going to drop a subject this semester. But the unit co-ordinators have said to stick it out and also apply for an extension if I need it.  But I know me, and I know I can do this.

Not something I am personally very used to. Overall I think I probably need to be a bit more proactive in my notetaking but so far I think I am doing a pretty good job.

I am greatly interested in the sorts of theories and concepts presented and it reaffirms a lot of the things I’ve learned over the past few years in the workforce.

I feel as though python is becoming easier to master, and the notes from the lecture as well as the exercises in class are quite helpful in achieving the desired outcomes. I am slowly approaching each question, getting stuck occasionally but I remember that the answer is most likely to be something simple; programming principles are based in simplicity so I feel that if I can ask the right question, the answer is usually readily available. I am still not entirely sure what regex, means but I aim to find out. The main thing that I am doing to approach these tasks is to be patient and persistent; sitting with a problem for a while, walking away and coming back seems to help me to reach a solution.

I thought the pace was too fast for me, who has just been introduced to the world of programming. The rate at which information was being offloaded was fast, giving me little time to even assimilate what I had learned and this was worrisome. At this stage, although I had already started earning the basic foundation about python programming language a little bit stuck in the middle for the  I think at this point, I think I am still persevering because this is something I really want to learn and understand. It’s a transferable skill. I couldn’t help but think that if I wasn’t this determined, I would have swapped a long time ago. And this standpoint is significant for me because I know it will keep me going even when it gets tough. I have also solidified my thoughts on my key components of success which are: Ensure I attend all lectures and studio classes (these studio classes are turning out to be amazing avenues for learning) Ensure I attend all tutorials Ensure I attempt all my tutorial exercises With each passing tutorial, lectures, studio classes, and numerous online resources, I am starting to feel much better with regards to my future with data analytics unit and my performance. With each tutorial exercise I get right, with each code I am able to decipher, understand, use appropriately and run, I feel much confident with the skills I am now acquiring and my increasing depth of knowledge. The unit itself is awesome and the skills that can be acquired are gold. However, sadly, I feel that the structure of this unit does not sufficiently cater for the vast background of students enrolling in this unit, especially students with little or no technical exposure. There was too much content to digest within 3 weeks and certain concepts that are still unclear. The unit is trying to teach several things all at once - basic coding, complex coding, data interpretation, and analytics. Personally, I still have to schedule additional hours weekly for more tutorial classes to enable me to gain more understanding, which shouldn't be. I believe breaking the unit structure into parts would be helpful for the next set of students. Weeks 1-4: Basic understanding of codes, libraries, and usage; Weeks 5 -13: Data analytics core. There are still some key challenges for me and they are the concept of variables, the ability to dissect a string and explain what each character is doing, the ability to retrieve data from APIs, working with unstructured data, etc. Although I feel my major challenge at this point is understanding Regex expressions and how they are derived. It is such a complicated section. Understanding these concepts and what they do and how they work has proved to be quite challenging and it is still an ongoing process.  In as much as I didn’t have an IT background, I realized that I wasn’t making the required effort to change the status quo. I have been digesting the reference materials and cheat sheets just to solve the tutorial tasks and not for the knowledge. This needed to change. I also observed that I wasn’t practicing continuously nor going beyond the exercises given.  I have started inculcating the plans I set out to ensure I understand this unit and I am also able to apply it in real-life scenarios. This is including an extra personal coaching session to help me understand the general basics of coding – the odes we use, why we use the codes we use, what they mean and how they can be manipulated to suit each different dataset.   I have stumbled upon several documentation and videos online which are helping and providing much-needed knowledge. I would like to be able to actually execute codes by myself and watch how the data insights unfold. That for me would be a great accomplishment at this point. This is just a starting point and I still have a long way to go if I truly want to obtain my much-desired data analytics skills"

2020-03-16T23:03:21.667255,bacfak79,58,group-1,"Post Tutorial 3:  Finished the assignment 1A workbook, and feel confident about how I found it. There was only a two questions which I got lost in; HTML and json/API question. All the actual python related coding I didn't find too hard so It should put me in good stead for actually completing actual data analysis in part B, and give me time to focus on the 'non tech/non python' aspect of analysis- formulating the questions, drawing conclusions ect. From the week 3 tutorial once aspect I think I will need to focus on and learn more about are the data visualisation packages. These packages have quite a lot to unpack and are not always that easy to port in from another situations because a lot of the arguments need adjusting. I also know that they are not just to make the data pretty but they do help a lot to view the data, draw conclusions and see relationships. This coming week there is no new content in lectures so it will be a good chance to dive into the remaining part of the project. Ideas for continued success: *Get started straight away on part B *Try and learn Matplotlib ect. "

Now I'm feeling quite a lot more confident with the lecture content and the code that we learnt these 3 weeks, I'm just waiting for the Part B so I can focus more how to solve the questions about the problem. I'm feeling better now with their help and I think that Catarina is the most helpful professor here at QUT since she is always ready to answer our questions. I'm ready now for part B."

In this case, we were working on the COVID-19 data set, where I was able to relate to the data very much and try to understand the data. it's in this week that, I realised the importance of critical thinking and looking at data from a different perspective. Also understanding how actually correlation vs causation works in a different scenario. As Andrew and catrina said in the class, it's all about asking the right question about the data, whether it may be of business concern or finding data pattern. In the beginning, I was wondering how can we say what is right and what is the wrong question, but after this week all dots are getting connected. I can say I'm much more interested now on working with real data than before since I have understood the steps involved whenever one is doing analysis with data."

Some approaches that I have done: 1. import counter from collections library - it gives me all words and the frequency of each word, however all unnecessary words (is, of ,etc) are also included (irrelevant data!).  2. Created new list of common used words - Adding new column (Topic) in dataframe based on the keyword list. The problem: there is 1million rows, and it is impossible to put all keywords into the list!

From my research (thanks to google), I found how to do topic modelling for strings. It uses a special library (I believe it is a machine learning library) named as Scikit Learn. There are some methods to use with LDA and NMF to be the most popular ones.  I tried LDA at first , after waiting for ages due to its time to load the data, I got a list of words in which probably relates to topic. However, I found that the words are not connected with each other. Henceforth, I tried NMF. After getting the result from NMF, the results are more meaningful to derive to the topics. Therefore, I use NMF :)"

If i run into a problem then i just have to ask for help from tutor- this will present problems now that we doing everything remotely but hopefully i can SLOWLY work my way through and ask pointed questions as least.

I could see and understand more about the criteria and now I'm a little more confident about my assignment 3 and what my professors are expecting. However, about the assignment 1, I have the perception that the help that my classmates provided to me was better than the help that I received on the tutorials.

Only to be met with anxiety from COVID both in work and University settings. I was able to remain calm and communicate with other members of my study group who helped me out with lecture notes. I still have not completed lecture 3 or the tutorial but have skimmed over them. I got a lot done on Tuesday by asking lots of questions and discussing issues I was having with the assignment with other members of our study group.  They were feeling the same about it all and we just got through the assignment until it was time to go to the drop in session. The drop-in-session was most helpful as I was able to get all of my questions answered for the assignment which pretty much covered the tutorial 3 Qs I had missed as well.

2020-03-21T11:05:19.783462,fabsev01,78,group-2,"1-What do I notice about my situation? What does it mean for me? Why is it significant? The first week of the Unit it as a mix of excitement and fear. I started the unit on the second running week because I was waiting for the University confirmation.   My last time studying at Uni it was more than 15 years ago. Nowadays the dynamic has changed a lot.  I took a week to understand how to find the information I wanted and more one week to sign in Slack etc. When I open the slack, I was even more in panic. I couldn’t understand any issues which people were posting about the Python codes.	 2. Feelings – How do I feel about this? Why do I feel this way? What do these feelings say about me as a learner? I understand that it is normal, especially because English is not my first language and sometimes, I need to read two or three times to understand the “message”.  But anyway, I feel frustrated in my first week. It looks like everyone nailed the questions and I was far behind them. 	 I’m not a coding person. Never liked. My goal to the Course is to develop more skills to understand Data e present them using easier tools like Tableau, PowerBi, etc. To stop the panic and start doing I remembered the time last year when I ran the Marathon and Half Marathon. I trained for that and I did it. 	 3. Challenge – What problems exist in my current situation? How do they challenge me? First, I stopped looking at Slack where everyone was far advanced. I started watching the Lecture video and the material. My training was my Assignment. Looking at the Tutorial material and “Googling” when I was stuck, helped me little by little getting the answers.   I need to read more carefully because it is too much information to get it.	 4. Self-critique – What should I improve and why? What other ideas can I use to improve myself? Get in touch with the Tutors will help me to break the barrier of communication and understand better what delivery should be. Ask more for help and stop trying by myself to sort it out.	 5. Potential solution – How can I improve in the future? How do others make these improvements? I believe that if I Investigate more and communicate more I will improve quickly. I need to break the communication barrier first.	 6. Learning opportunity – How do I want to change in the future? How can I learn from other perspectives in the future? What do I plan to do about it? In which direction do I head next? "

Then I remember the data analytic cycle - QDAVI. Which was very well explained in the Week 3 tutorial. So I stared with that, taking a small step at the beginning towards the right question to ask, derived from the concern of the assessment question. I started moving towards, understanding data and missing values. When it comes with understanding and handling the missing data, critical thinking plays a very important role. To get familiarised with data, I started with plotting different variable  so that I understand the data, missing values and coherence of variables"

Having prior knowledge about Python did help me a bit to gain some insights during the interactive tutorial. I am very confident and excited to learn new tools, have a deeper understanding on how to think like an analyst and also to ask the right questions. Seemingly with how my timetable was structured, I think I would be able to balance all my units perfectly for this semester. I did ponder over how this course was gonna work because as initially planned, instead of having two lectures and one tutorial, Monday's were changed as the only sit down lecture and Tuesday's was a in-depth studio session to aid the previous day's lecture. Having enrolled into the Tuesday's time slot would definitely hinder me but I plan on watching the recorded lecture to prepare for it. Making a study group with students who did attend the previous lecture would be an excellent solution to my problem."
2020-03-22T13:40:15.657185,paxzem68,38,group-2,"Week two was a lot harder than I had thought. As I was not able to attend the lecture, I was sort of lost during the studio session where the discussions about the topic were out of reach for me. Recorded lecture wasn't a big help because there were major issues with audio. I had to reshuffle my timetable, which perhaps made me slightly annoyed. Study sessions with some of my very helpful classmates were of great use to me so that during the tutorial I would not feel out of place. But tagging along the tutorial was itself a major task because I soon realized that I have to work 2x harder than my peers to overcome this. Things like Regex were completely new to me. If only I had paid attention to course structure from day 1 things would have been less hectic. Maybe finding a common free time with my study group and making quick notes for easier reference would most likely make things a lot easier! Also arranging my study time outside university lectures is something I should focus on."
2020-03-22T13:49:29.489175,paxzem68,27,group-2,"Safe to say week three was the worst because study load from other units definitely came crashing down on me. Adjusting my lecture and keeping up wit the tutorial sessions took a toll on me. I thought i had planned my timetable properly to allow me to revise all units but I failed to take regard of my own coping time. Assignments and Quiz took most of my hours though-out the week, which left me with close to no time for IFN619. Having a bit of experience of Python did not help this time, because I had to ask Google, my classmates, friends from back home to help me navigate through this week. Most online resources are helpful but it take a lot of time to find a solution exactly related to your problem. having said that Slack community did play a huge role, but again it took too many scrolls to judge the ongoing topic on the channel. All I wish is I cope okay for the upcoming week.  "
2020-03-23T01:20:05.976166,bacfak79,60,group-2," Although not ideal, I don't think it will affect mee too bady becasue I have been able to guide myself independantly so far, the important thing for me in learning is to have a logical course structure with deadlines. I'm normally able to solve issues and teach myself new things one they have been introduced, so I still feel confident. One of the biggest challenges will be completion of Assessment 1B (Already achieved 12/12 for 1A), the reason it will be a challeneg is sometimes I can be inefficient when the Question/task is open ended/not strictly defined. 1B there are two questions to answer but no formula- we can use any data/any techniques available, so I feel that it is possible for me to loose a lot of time exploring (which is ok) with out getting anywhere. I think to over come this I need to follow ONLY 1 line of thought in the beginning and follwow it all the way to the end in terms of analysis, and then refine and edges at the end. I will see how this goes. I lost quite a bit of time trying to grab data from APIs for assessment 1B when maybe it wasn't nessessary. I should accept quick and dirty methods to save time-downloading data and collating a csv may have been more approprite. I only realised this through reading discussions on Slack, becuase other people where asking if this was acceptable, I think It will help me to continue to monitor Slack because I will naturally get guidance from reading what other students are up to. So for the next few weeks going forward I need to be efficient and not elegant. I need to dive in to the two questions from 1B and get 'pen to paper'so to speak in terms of getting a rough back bone to each question, then the final two weeks can be about finessing the result/method. So overall still progressing well- just a bit frustrated with intital progress because I got hung up on A) using API instead of the path of least resistance, B) just generally loosing direction with the question Other points: I did make good progress learning parts of Matplotlib- this will be important becasue I need to be able to 'see' relationships in particular ways to draw conclusions and I think its possible to loose a lot of time if you dont understand the nuances of plotting. One question I would like to ask lectures is regarding the optimal way to set up a 'data analysis' workspace, like how to organise tools and reference material so it can be accessed quickly in one spot."

Perhaps I am being too hard on myself. I struggle to compare things adequately around me. Told not to compare the self to others and where or how they might be progressing along, however this is something that I find exceptionally difficult to filter out (haha! excuse the pun in word choice). Finding that stress levels are a little better on some fronts however this Corona virus looming and the changes that have been coming into play during study-campus hours and outside study hours (which hasn't been nearly enough available time at this point) has been a bit frightening due to the uncertainity of it all and also the logistics - personal and organisational. There have been further changes again that I have had to make in this realm that have contributed to the levels of stress (still being experienced).  I was aware that there dwould be a great deal of change that I would be going through, however I wasn't thinking that it would feel quite so challenging at uni as it has been. I am managing, I guess. The virus has perhaps contributed to stress levels remaining as is. It is just fortunate that this course can perhaps help to keep me occupied during these peculiar times. Over and out until the end of this week."
2019-03-04T06:47:27.715841,hovrab95,30,group-2,"Attempting my very first tutorial preparatory task was quiet challenging and I think this was mainly because I was still trying to grasp the meaning and idea of ‘what research is’ and also catch up on all the readings that were required for week 1. I finally got to understand from a fellow student that I am required to only focus on the recommended readings (and read prescribed readings only if I have the time). In the course of doing this task, I was able to understand the importance of identifying a research problem which is the foundation, as this would help me then develop a research question. The main difficulties and struggles I experienced while I was doing this preparatory task are posed below in form of questions: •	Is it really feasible for me to discover a problem in need of a research that is novel, will solve a need and hasn’t been thought about by anyone in the past before? •	How can I avoid plagiarism in executing my task or does it not matter at this initial point? •	Do I cite references for the identified research problem? At what point would I be required to start citing references whilst in the process of developing a research question? •	How do I summarize a research problem in one paragraph, addressing the background of the problem, the problem, the importance of solving the problem and what new knowledge I would need to solve the problem? Am I allowed to segment them? •	Are we required to perform a literature review before stating what our research problem is? The fact that the research problem had to have an element of technology in it was also a bit tricky.  Another challenging aspect was the context of the research problem especially because of the fact that a problem or need for one geographical area/country/region might not be a problem or need for another region or geographical area. How do I balance this in my research problem write-up? Is it ethical to identify a research problem that is not seen as a problem in other ethnicities? One thing especially that I found to be highly useful was the article on brain writing exercise 2 and the various starting points suggested like having an area of interest which availed me some of the ideas I used like the following areas – Road Safety and Vehicles, Aged and Healthcare, Business and Customers, Environment and Health, etc.  Once I was able to think of the areas of interest and possible problems, it was a bit easier to align my thoughts towards identifying a possible research problem.

I really enjoyed the “Frame-storming” exercise with other teammates during the tutorial and I thought we did a great job even we were not known with each other before. Lots of problems of the central problem were identified alongside some innovative solutions by our teamwork, that was a quite interesting and enjoyable experience for me. However, when I did my Prep Task 1a to discover my own interested topic for further research, I still struggled to develop a worthwhile problem. Frankly speaking, the first thing is how you define the “Worthwhile Problem”. Secondly, as for me, there are some overlaps among the social, technological and business problems especially between social and business perspective, I need to figure out the differences among them. Furthermore, during the process of digging problems, I tried to read some related literature for help, but I still don’t have a clear picture of how to accomplish this research. So, for me to resolve these concerns, I think more knowledge introduced in the future lecture can be helpful to some extent, but to make it more effective, I will try to discuss more details with other peers and the tutor in the future weeks."

2019-03-05T01:03:23.922769,hovrab95,59,group-2,"Now I can briefly summarize research to mean identifying ideas to enhance new knowledge. This week's lecture focused on literature review and how important it is to keep track of the materials and articles we stumbled across or that we have been reading for our identified research problem (for TUT), artistically map it to our research problem, identify the trends, commonality across papers and the eventual splits across various authors. It also stressed on the need to identify various methods used, their findings and ultimately, how it relates to my research problem.  I realised that I haven't been keeping track of my articles, sources and some of these for me included YouTube videos (not a trustworthy source) and TED videos and articles (I need to find out if these can qualify as trustworthy publications).  My major take-home from this lecture is that even though my research problem needs to be unique/novel, I would be building on the knowledge of others and their previous works and of course all these would need to be cited appropriately.  Now comes my challenge - how to cite when writing using the recommended APA reference method, which everyone but me seems to know about. Our first tut class task was to identify 3 research problems, would I be doing literature review for all the problems? I would find out in TUT class what the expectation is then I would know how to proceed. "

Technically I think, this is exactly what I was looking for data analytics! I am so excited to study more.

Logistical personal disruptions in commuting, internet and software access issues off campus have led to me having to overhaul a few things going on in my personal life for one. The other matter I have had to attempt to minimise is the health contact with others. An additional reason for needing to shift how I have been handling everything going on around me - at uni and away.  As I already mentioned all of the changes (and sudden) pushed out a good start in my week. I have had to adjust to a new pattern of working.

These worked well- what I think is really usefull about the videos is that you can have juypter notebook open on  a second screen and play aorund with the code as the lecture is talking, I think this is fair superior toonly listening and then trying emuulate a few days later when you have forgotten. Other benifit is that you can pause videos/rewatch sections. negative is that if you are busy with other work you are may never get around to watch the videos- i guess this is more of a matter of self disipline, but i never had this issue with physical lectures.  I've made very little progress on the assignment 1B this week so naturally my anxiety increases due to less time to complete but still same about of ''unknown'- unknown as in i don't know how long it will take/if ill get stuck on sections. The main reason i havent made progress is because Ive been trying to finish other work in other courses. I think at this stage the anxiety doesn't match the situation- theres still enough time and once i get down to it, im sure I can finish the assignment in 1 week of 3 hours a day.  The good thing is that I have two concurrent assignments in similar jyputuer/python/data format- the other being data mining. Surely there will be synergies of working on these together."

2020-04-03T11:40:44.610636,hovrab95,35,group-2,"REFLECTIVE JOURNAL It was quite an unsettling feeling after my first week of lecture, studio and tutorial sessions, that just maybe this time, I may have bitten more than I could chew in choosing this unit as an elective this semester. At the time, it seemed that I was being taught several things all at once. The content was a lot to digest all at once. I also thought that the teaching pace was too fast for me. This resulted in a huge uncertainty regarding my readiness to journey into the world of programming.  I was concerned that I had little time to even assimilate what I was being taught and this was worrisome. I found myself facing certain hurdles that were potential roadblocks to my performance in the unit. I had no programming foundational knowledge and here I was, expected to ‘deep dive’ into the coding world with my non-existent technical background whilst still trying to learn data analytics. The first week saw me going through a self-searching phase where I acknowledged the fact that I had to make a decision - swapping data analytics for another elective or embarking on a very challenging learning journey. Later, once the decision to stay was made, I realised I was relieved although I knew it was going to be a steep learning curve. I had a purpose and I was more confident in persevering through the learning curve. Interestingly, I felt somewhat justified with my decision following the very first task, which was to work on basic markdown and python exercises. I found working through those markdown exercises to be quite interesting and easy, with the hope that the assessments would be the same! I really felt happy, proud and encouraged with the outcomes of my completed tasks. I felt that I had been worrying needlessly. I started feeling much more confident with regards to my performance by the completion of certain tutorial tasks such as importing libraries, defining functions, reading CSV files, retrieving random pictures from APIs and printing data frames. I felt like I had acquired new cool skills. For me, it was such an exhilarating feeling. Nonetheless, that feeling of euphoria didn’t last long and the fear arose. It was more of a dual feeling for me. For instance, on one hand, I felt scared while on the other hand, I felt challenged as a student whose sole purpose is to learn and acquire knowledge. This happened when I began to struggle with some of the basic python exercises. Likewise, I felt the same way when trying out some of the text structuring exercises. The use of 'regex' was such a foreign and illogical concept. In contrast, the exercises involving data and picture retrieval from APIs were fun tasks, although there was that initial hurdle of locating the correct API to use. Ultimately, the majority of that fear could be attributed to a lack of understanding of the essence of those tasks. Understandably, these hurdles experienced within the first two weeks, made me feel very inadequate to perform well in this unit. I felt disheartened and very disappointed in myself with each failed attempt. I had always considered myself a quick study but I felt this whole experience with 'data analytics' was proving to be the exception. Although both provided good learning avenues, the studio sessions though interactive, didn’t quite have that individual component which the tutorial classes had.    Despite these experiences and feelings, I knew I still had a very long way to go as there are still some key challenges for me. I struggled with understanding the usage of ‘while loops’ and ‘pop’ functions, text structuring and the concept of indexing in data frames.  Furthermore, for the data analytics process, I started learning there was much more that code copying involved. More importantly was the need to understand what questions I am trying to solve and what the codes are required to do. In addition, I felt another key challenge was primarily not knowing if I was on the right problem solving path or what I was doing wrong, especially in cases when I had syntax errors after running certain codes. There was also the added frustration of not having a reference point to validate my results. This basic understanding of the right codes to use to extract information in any given scenario is essential to me as a learner and a potential data analyst. Admittedly, regardless of my non-existent technical background, I realised that I wasn’t earnestly exploring all channels available to change the status quo. I had been digesting the reference materials and cheat sheets with the sole purpose of solving the tutorial tasks and not necessarily to acquire knowledge. This needed to change. I also observed that I wasn’t practicing continuously nor going beyond the exercises given. I had remained in my comfort zone.  Ultimately, I knew I had to invest more time and effort if I wanted to excel in this unit. Most importantly, as a kinaesthetic learner, I knew I had to not only read but also practice continuously.  I began by scheduling additional hours weekly for personal tutorial classes. My search for understanding the ‘why’ behind every action, what the codes were doing in every scenario, the concept of executing certain activities such as creating variables and objects, printing on new lines, concatenating and text strings were, proved to be fruitful. I experienced a huge reduction in my fears. The following weeks has found me settling down into the unit and trying my possible best to excel with an outlined plan for success. Moreover, my results from the Part A of the first assignment was indeed an indication that I was learning and improving. Each passing week has solidified my conclusion that there are certain components that are critical for my success in this unit. As a next step, I need to be consistent with practicing the tutorial exercises and seeking additional help where possible. In fact, with each passing tutorial, studio classes, and numerous external resources, I believe I am slowly but surely heading in the right direction. Data Analytics seems to be a combination of several concepts from process mining, research methodology, and excel techniques. For instance, like in research, the starting point for data analytics is asking the right questions that would provide a solution to the business problem or concern. Likewise, the same approach of analysing data in excel is being adopted, whereby you first have to filter your data to removes values you don't need, then the data is sorted to explore various outputs which are then displayed in charts. Data analytics achieves all this on a much larger scale. Data analytics is definitely a value add especially in my specialty where analysis on process data is required and reports on huge data set for management decision making.  Surely, once I am able to navigate the bumpy road, I believe I will be able to fully grasp and apply the principles behind data analytics, which might just give me the edge that I desire, by providing certain technical skills that would be of value in the labour industry.

Still an enormous bit of work ahead to wade through before the first due date of the first assessment arrives. So not feeling better than ok as yet. I do aspire to though :). "

I need to go back over the work and go over slack to see what I am lacking. I feel like I will struggle to start Part B, especially when it comes to observing the data and what I have to work with but it will test me around what path I take and how I will delivery a conclusive recommendation based on the chosen data  "

We had a scare a work with an employee and the corona virus (tested negative thank god). Uni went online and I had to learn new technologies such as Zoom etc. The unit was thrown in a little bit of chaos but got back on it's feet. I had to take a break from EFN619 to complete my work in my other unit. I could see that QUT was going to break for 2 weeks so made sure that I set the time aside for catching up. Luckily everything was recorded. I am still working full-time with the added challenge of home schooling my 7 year old son. I shuttle between the office and home.   I am currently working on my Assignment Part B and struggling with the cleaning part. However, I feel confident I will work it out. I have pretty much worked out the data/columns I want to use to answer the question but am waiting for confirmation from my tutor.  I am watching week 6 lectures as much as I can and have yet to watch the tutorial questions. I still have 1 week before Uni goes back so I am ok for now as long as QUT staff answer my queries. "

This things matter to me and I needed a break, how it will impact my grades I am not sure, I know I will not fail, but this was a difficult time in my life that require my full attention and prescence.

This is my first ever attempt to write a journal.I have enrolled into IFN - 619 anticipating personal progress on how to make good decisions when involved in a corporate circumstances at my work. In the first lecture Andrew gave a summary on course outcomes and structure. Catarina explained the course structure and few keen insights. Though I found it difficult to understand her accent at first, now I am able to understand better. I used to have a personal laptop in India but I haven't brought it with me as it was a old one. I planned to buy a new one as soon as possible after settling in Brisbane. I searched for some best deals at retail stores and online e-commerce websites. I finally decided to order from dell.com.au because of student discounts they offered on high standard laptops. But there was a hurdle, my order got delayed due to the covid outbreak. I have attended my first tutorial of IFN-619 without a laptop. It was very difficult completing the excercises without a  laptop. Later on I got to know we can use the QUT digital library  where all the work can be saved in cloud. But soon I felt my tutorials are not very productive without laptop. I tried to share a laptop with another student. He is Vikram from Nepal. It was nice meeting another person, he is in his 3rd semester. He explained me how I can get a temporary laptop from HiQ on daily basis. Without wasting any more time, I approached HiQ and they helped me immediately with a working laptop. I am glad I now had a temporary work around to my problem without compromising my studies. After 2 more weeks I have received my own laptop. Another experience I would like to share is how I got "

One reason behind this might be due to my prior background in economics study, hence, I find the question is really interesting. One bad thing is that I spent a lot of time doing this question.

Fortunately, you not only provided online courses and tutorials, but also set the duration of the videos and tutorials to be more suitable for learning remotely. Thank you very much. In terms of learning, the teaching method of case analysis is very intuitive, which makes it easy for me to understand the relevant principles. Combined with the technology in the case and other online learning, my ability to use Python is also rapidly improving. Everything is on the track. At present, my biggest confusion is that when analyzing certain data, it may be due to lack of data processing skills or insufficient knowledge about the analysis object, and I cannot find obvious insights from it."

This includes seeking other online resources too. I do know that coding could be fun as i experienced this when i tried solving the 'Code in Place' karel python exercises for a stanford CS106A coding class i signed up for. Unfortunately, i wasn't selected this time. A realization for me is that this is something i really want to learn and i am so keen to learn. Perhaps the looming assessments and timeline are adding unnecessary pressure to my learning pattern. I do have ups and downs every week. Some days are really good and i feel like i am getting a grasp of python coding but on some other days, the struggle can be a bit overwhelming. Two main areas for me are question development and refining and machine learning (the concept of tree classifiers, train and test data).  "

2020-04-16T14:41:49.944537,hovrab95,46,group-3,"It really hasn't been easy refining the question or developing questions to guide the data analysis process. So far, from what i have done, i do see how critical it is to know what the problem is or what the business concern is. This is because it forms the foundation of the entire analysis. It shapes the questions that will be formed and shapes the tone of the analysis, the variables that will be isolated and the techniques that will be used. So fundamentally, if this part is not done well, it has the potential to bias the whole analysis. Now having read my chosen questions for part B of the assessment, i have spent a lot of time trying to see the kind of questions i can form that will ultimately help me address the business concern. I have discovered that it is not as easy as developing research questions. In research question development, you have a topic you will be researching into and developing questions from. And you are not restricted by data. However, here, i am struggling to find questions that can be solved by the available dataset available for me to analyse. One thing that bugs me is if I am perhaps tackling it the wrong way. Maybe, i shouldn't focus on data, i should form good questions and then being able to answer the questions will be another matter entirely. I could say i am unable to answer the questions based on unavailability of data. This can then come with a recommendation for the next survey questions to have 'xyz' columns. Now perhaps i might have to go back and rephrase my questions to 'rich' questions. I am grasping the entire data cleaning process. It has helped knowing the recommended sequence for cleaning up any given data, what to look out for, how to approach cleaning, etc. I would say i am feeling a little good but i am not where i want to be yet in terms of confidence level."

The first part is the lecturers presented themselves then went through the unit structure e.g. when we have an assignment and when we will have an exam. From my perspective is part is actually useful because students will know what they have to do in this cause, and we can also as the lectures. the next part, Catharina presented Python code, this is the first time in my life that I have to use Jupyter notebook and Github as my leaning space. I felt everything was so advanced here, and I normally learned computer subjects through intranet network. As for, my tutorial is week was fine because it's not that hard just had exercises about markdown which is an exercise that I can press a button on help Jupyter notebook. Another point about this subject is I felt that it was not a very interesting subject. I enrolled in this subject because I had no choice. This subject actually scares me since I do not have any knowledge about Python. However, in the first week, I got to meet new friends and meet new societies that made me realised there is much help out there at this university. "

I felt my life was getting tough because I could not catch up with my friend but still understand some of them. For my tutorial this week was getting harder. Even, I asked Abdul how to do the exercise and he showed me how to use regex, I still do not understand. Since regex is complicated for me because it has too many symbols, and I cannot remember all of them. We use regex to capture things that you want to extract from text. We need the symbols to sift out the patterns, and I find that it is hard to sift out the patterns if I don’t know all the symbols. For this week I felt that I should withdraw this unit because I cannot do it. However, my friends talked to me that I can do it. After my friends encouraged me, I felt that I was more encouraged and ready to try again. "

I had the feeling that I wanted to cry in a tutorial class. At that time, I was like a person who had no concentration and I was not able to analyse the programming logic. Although, I was lucky to have my friends explain what to do and what steps to take for this exercise. I still felt bad and It was a worse feeling than the last week's feelings. So, after I finished class I decided to call my father that I wanted to withdraw this unit, but the conditions of my study require that I do this unit, or a similar unit that is probably just as hard. I spoke to my dad about it, and he says that even if I don’t do it now, at some point of my life, I’m going to have to do work that is as hard as this. Why should I leave this problem to later, when I can get it finished now, and save myself the worry. My father also let me know that this subject has some perks, because it doesn’t have an exam, although he says that I shouldn’t be slacking off, and that if this subject is just about copying and pasting stuff, then I should probably leave it. But most importantly, if there are challenges, he says that I shouldn’t be scared, as I have lecture material to support my learning experience, and I live in a time of Google, which is good. I also use w3schools to help me get better at working with basic Python code. W3schools has small exercises for each topic, and this is good because I feel that when I am actually doing the work, it is easier to remember than simply being told what to do. Moreover, in week 3 I had to submit 1st assignment for 1st attempt. I can tell that this is quite challenge. I found that not only W3schools can help improve my studies but also going to the comments in the lecture material has provided me with extra information to supplement my learning experience. "

This week is a no lecture week, but there is still a tutorial where students can ask questions to the teachers, which I think is very useful. I asked a question that I was not able to do with teachers e.g. question number 6 which about Grouping Columns, Catarina explained very well about it step by step. In addition, I have a feeling that when I do work in the workshops or assignment, I notice that something that I do a lot is copy stuff without fully knowing where it has come from, or what it does. This is a problem that I need to fix about myself because I want to understand everything that I am writing, and I know that currently, I don’t fully understand all of the unit content e.g. even, I understand how to pull raw data, I have no idea where it came from and how to find raw data by myself. The solution for this should more be reading or being explained more in detailed and the compulsory thing is more practise. "

At first, I thought that online learning has to be really difficult because 4 weeks before I felt that learning python is something that quite difficult. I think I definitely don't get it. However, from what I learned in video clips, everything is described in sequential steps. For instance, Andrew describes the use of regex from the start, such as importing, using regex to extract data, using function to search. It gives me the feeling that it's not really as difficult as I imagine. In order to extract the business concerns for responding to the question, last week I tried to do as Catarina described on lecture, but I still struggle, I do not know how I actually had to write, and where to start. For this week, Catarina explained in the clip one more time in details, including writing which step should be first. What is the next step to extract business concern? She also shows resources that are useful for reporting. These create many ideas for me to do assignment the most favourite thing in this week is Catarina draws some pictures to demonstrates the steps. After I watch all the clips I try to do what Catarina taught e.g. try to divide the topic that I want to illustrates and what topic is interesting. after that, I try to find more data set to support my analysis, for me personally, this part is also difficult to find what data you want because something they are not covered your desire.

2020-04-17T15:16:25.662553,zofdox34,48,group-3,"In week 6, teaching is still online as the last week. But in this week Andrew divided the teaching group into two groups, which are groups that need help with coding and advance group. I am confident that I will definitely choose the group that needs help with coding. Because the assignment part B is the part that requires the combination of coding technique and data analysis, unlike part A assignment that I needed to type the code to answer the question. After I finished zoom class with Andrew. I tried to apply what I learned to my work. However, I find that some of them are useful and match with my work. I also did search more from Google and combine with lecture material. The only thing that I find that it is too difficult for me is machine learning. I tried to do question 2 and 3 of part B assignment but once I realised I may have to do machine learning for question 3 I decide to change. Even I did explore some data e.g. I did find the duplicated words that have been used the most in the last decade. From my perspective, question 1 has too much data that needs to be cleaned but I assume that I will survive with this question so now I decide to work on question 1 and 2. "

I hope that the professors could see my efforts for this project / assignment. I'm really giving my all to make this the perfect assignment for this unit."

2019-03-10T08:15:03.143646,hovrab95,60,group-3,"Reflecting on the execution of my preparatory task in week 2 (focus on literature review), categorizing my research problem statement into the different headers highlighted during the tutorial was done with a little struggle. The headers were: Broad central problem, nature of the problem, problem domain, unit of analysis, motivation (significance), research gaps (novelty) and outcomes. It seemed to me that headers 1, 2 and 3 were quite similar and it seemed like i was repeating the same information just in different ways. My initial solution was to first understand my research problem and clearly define the scope thereby setting boundaries.  Another challenging aspect was mapping or keeping track of my literature review. I initially tried capturing it on a notebook but finally adopted the use of excel template which helped me basically to keep track of my search findings and readings and this proved helpful and I wish I had started it on time (as I had to go back to trace every webpage I ever visited for information which was tedious). I also used colour codes to help highlight the various topics along the search. I haven't quite mastered the art of searching using databases in QUT Find. Referencing was another huge challenge as am relatively new to this. Obtaining my first degree outside Australia did not prepare me for this. I had to really read a lot of articles to clearly understand the concept of APA which was the required referencing type for the task. Despite that, I believe I still struggled with regards to how to capture the book titles and if it is an encyclopedia what do you capture and how is it captured? Also, how do I capture the volumes and the book editions or the journals editions? Is there a way to directly link article search from google scholar to QUT Find? Overall, I think am quite happy with the progress I have made so far. "

I am very proud that I have the drive, and I know that what is happening to me is out of my control in a way. I just need to take each day at a time and move forward. Look at the end of the day, I am learning new things and learning to overcome very difficult challenges. It is nobody's fault and I am just glad that QUT is being considerate of the challenges that we are facing as students especially ones that study part time and have extra responsibilities outside of university life such as myself. In regards to the assignment, I had to rework both my questions as I was trying to over complicate the analysis of the questions. I realized that I just needed to use the coding that I knew and was taught in class and apply my critical analysis an reasoning to the data. KISS principle was applied. Patrick helped a lot in understanding how the question was supposed to be answered. "

This week's learning and deadlines coupled with some other unrelated factors made me feel like an athlete running a steeplechase race, where various obstacles had to be put into consideration.  I know now that mastery can only come out of practice, practice, and more practice. I am hoping for more focus next week."

2020-04-27T05:57:07.670929,fabsev01,34,group-3,Frustrated as I spend a lot of time finding out how to do basic codes in Python. It is getting better but not too much time to search for a cool viz or either to keep analyzing new finds.

2019-08-11T11:10:41.058934,hisviv08,79,group-3,"IFN623 - week 3 - In general I think this week has been the most productive for me in learning how lex works and what I can do with it. As I’ve started to build utterances and intents and have a go at using slots, I feel I am learning more about how the interaction design principles apply to the bot design, whereas before it was a bit abstract. I didn’t find the actual building of the bot too challenging given my previous experience programming, but I did discover that someone had removed all my intents and added their own into my bot. I quickly learned to keep a JSON export backup of each major version of the bot that I publish just in case. I definitely think there’s more for me to learn with lambda functions and I always wanted to get into “serverless” design anyway, so this would be a good opportunity to understand it better. "
2019-08-11T11:11:27.003230,hisviv08,69,group-3,"IFN600 - week 3 - I think I am starting to see how these research questions come together. In spite of the fact that I don’t have a use for it in my current role, I’ve come to appreciate it as a valuable skill even just for basic things like briefing papers and reports. It’ll probably be challenging for me to come up with a good meta analysis of how I did my research, but I’ll do my best. There’s definitely more opportunity for me to learn about how research projects are incepted and how they’re applied to the real world (especially in my industry of aviation). "
2020-04-28T12:46:44.399309,zofdox34,51,group-3,"Having to tell the truth that this week 7 was a week that felt that everything is busy because my assignment is not finished. I also just found out the end of week 6 that actually I have to write my GOING OK every week I thought I can write on Microsoft word first then just copy and paste so after that I copied what I work to GOING OK but it seems not ok for me because I did rate self-reflection wrong for my week 2 and week 3, I was sleepy so I have done a thing wrong but I hope everything can be fixed so I decide to upload them again but I don't know how can I delete the previous one that I posted wrong. As for week 7 which I actually drag myself back to study Python again after I submitted assignment las Friday night. I just watched all the clips uploaded for week 7, the first and second topics seem not too hard for me This topic is related to subset exploration and using JSON library to narrow down the data and extract story in the data, for example, using IF to find the word 'science' and find science story. While the second topic is about using GENSIM library this one sound interesting because we can use this library to help to process text. Moreover, tokenising can be used for getting rid of non-character information for example, 'the', 'a', 'and' and 'that'. However, the last two topics which are TFIDF and LDA. I  kind of get the concept but not thoroughly understand. I may need to watch the lecture record 2 more times. However, for this week I attended the lecture on zoom and I found it was quite fun since we started class with TED talk VDO which talked about Bubble Filter, each individual will see different results from google reach even on Facebook based an individuals internet activity. After the VDO we have a chance to exchange ideas about Bubble Filter with classmates (a group of 5) in a private group in zoom."

2020-04-29T09:31:23.240810,zofdox34,60,group-3,"week 8, Andrew focused on using data analytic in the real world and talked about assignment 2. From my perspective the lecture this week is very useful for my analysing since I selected stream A. There are 3 topics for this week including; data-driven decision making, potential issues and personal principles. Within data-driven decision making is explained about understanding the nature of data. As for potential issues, there are numerous factors that data analyst need to be aware of, such as false assumptions and algorithmic bias. As data analysts, we have to consider how our analytics will be useful for others for a short and long time (consistency and repeatability). For me, this point is imperative because if the data is misleading or out of date, it causes failure in decision making. Another important thing Andrew explained through assignment 2 hand out as well as the criteria. For instance,  Andrew explained what is leaning outcome from this assignment and what he expects to see from my assignment 2, basically, everything he explains in this video is clear to understand. Therefore, I think the ideas of taking video is great because I can keep checking my work with this video."
2020-05-01T06:13:17.947027,dubgum43,59,group-3,"Wk7: Close of Week 7 I have found some things have been working both better and not so great with the changes that have come in due to the impact of COVID-19. I have been quite flat out and had to make adjustments in my personal life to keep things running smoothly so that I can continue on with my studies with minimal disruptions. I have also realised how I can improve my approach with my journal entries while the learning will also develop.  If I reflect upon the flurry over the past few weeks (which includes the easter break itself) and week 7, it has left me feeling less than satisfied. I have felt that I was unable to marry questions properly with the volume of work that went on to achieve the analysis itself -  for which I initially set out to do. I found it really challenging trying to deliver useful analysis; let alone bringing it back to align with the overaching questions themselves. Throughout the process it was apparent just how easy new questions could emerge and that this in itself I found tricky. I did feel that I learnt quite a lot from it all, such as ways I could help myself to generate a better starting plan. Or how I could better tackle the actual question before even embarking upon the analysis itself. I felt I was carrying out a bit of a juggling act as I tried to complete part B of the assessment. I took longer on the first part than I had hoped for. On a positive note I believe that I now have some better processes that I could use to help keep myself on task going fourth.  During the course of the past few weeks I also encountered growing personal factors (both with my course work and outside it) that became unavoidable and had to be tackled. The logistical and organisational ones led me to using Anaconda to carry on more smoothly with my work and resolve one of the organisational difficulties quickly. I have been managing as best as possible. But it has brought me to a place of needing to force a break upon myself, even though it came after the uni break. But this has helped me immensely as far as I am concerned and I'm feeling better about more things which is great. The analysis process highlighted how easy it can be to lose sight of the overaching questions (or a business query). And then to travel down this path readily. Throughout the stages of the analysis process questions would emerge even just within a single dataframe, just by taking a look at it. This in itself doesn't even take in to account the tools and techniques of producing good quality analysis. Nor whether the analyst is experienced or proficient enough to obtain better or more datasets to investigate. I felt I only managed to get an exposure that touched on the tip of the iceberg. Accepting the amount of time at hand is just as critical. Experience plays an obvious role and this assessment helped to illustrate that loud and clear."
2020-05-01T06:17:32.813500,fabsev01,51,group-3,"The Assignment is delivered. I've done the best that I could do it. In the middle of a pandemic lifestyle, I made my best.  It is hard to be at the same pace as the lessons are doing. I decided not to watch any other lessons until I finish my assignments. I'm doing at a different pace, considering my normal life has changed because of the COVID-19 pandemic.  During the week I want to give up the course and look for how I could start again next year.  Doing on my pace I started to like Python, although it is not easy to get the graph that I want to show on my assignments. I did as simple as I could. I used to think to show the data in a specific graph but usually is too time-consuming to search and correct the errors, so I used to give up and show simply. Time is precious nowadays. The assignments could be better, I know. As much as I look to data, I find something new to think about, search, and show. No time for that. Abstract and keep doing as it is it was the best decision. I can see data differently, now. I know there is too much to learn but that open my mind to the new (JSON, Python, Machine Learn), still not easy but interesting. "

In terms of data analysis, intentionally establishing biased algorithms and models and using modified data to obtain certain models or conclusions to obtain improper benefits must be vigilant. But I used to think that the use of unsuitable technologies or algorithms due to ability problems, the use of problematic data would only lead to failed models or products, and these failures ultimately just lead to failure. I never thought that some of these 'failures' might not be easily noticed by authors or users, which would also lead to serious consequences, and it is also worthy of vigilance. In the process of data analysis, we must always pay attention to this."
2020-05-04T08:22:21.929677,mobkif05,40,group-3,"This is my first time I am writing a journal in my life, I don’t even know where to begin with and what is the generic format that is accepted for a journal, so I will write this journal honestly to see what I really thought and felt for the first 3 weeks for the IFN619 course. I would appreciate any feedback to improve my journal writing skills because I really feel that I need to learn a lot. Apologies in advance if I am crass. This is my first semester in QUT, and it began with the studio session on 24th February morning for IFN619, I was a little anxious as I arrived little late (about 20min), so naturally I was unable to focus on the lecture thoroughly which made me think that I would lag behind to learn the course but, surprisingly I have found the tutor to teach me the course in a more realistic and relatable way rather than delving more into code. I felt it personally more engaging and interesting to learn in such way where real life examples were used to analyse the data.  	 I did not face any difficult challenge but Python which is a new language for me was a little challenging, I managed to learn just enough to understand this course for the time being. The first two weeks were a little uneasy for me as I had a bit of a struggle learning how to approach this subject in a which is suitable way for me, but with help of few friends I managed to get back on track. I faced little bit of a challenge while learning regex as well, but with help of tutors I could now manage to write regular expressions when required. The assignment1-Part A was the actual one that really helped me learn a lot about the basics of how to do the 5 steps (loading, cleaning, analysis, visualisation and draw insights). I learnt how to look through the data set for identifying the indicators that are responsible for core analysis depending on the use case. As I rely more on self-learning, (which is the way I have always ever been) I feel I could improve on learning the subject more when discussed more with peers and tutors like for example: any doubts that needs to be asked less hesitantly, communicating more with other students which could result in gaining an experience on how the others perspective on the same problem of yours.  AS of now due to this COVID-19 and the self-isolation I really am trapped inside my home with less social interaction. I always prefer to communicate and meet in person as It feels more interactive and refreshing to my mind.  So, I am hoping the see this pandemic come to a greater control when I can come to the University and feel the breath of fresh air. "

This has got me pondering about a whole bunch of things and asking questions that I do not know if I would like that answers to. Going through various cases of biased sentencing made me very aware of my heritage and made me think of various injustices individuals face on a daily basis. This has even heightened my skepticism of various news feeds, articles, and maybe even policies. After realizing that so much research has been carried out on the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence, one would have thought that these were for the advancement of society, not exploiting these tools to suit a group of individuals. These few weeks have prompted my looking beyond the headlines and analyzing other sources of information to make for a better view of issues.  I feel there is so much to work I need to cover in the next few weeks and hope I can make use of my time judiciously. "

I'm really happy with that, I think that I can answer the questions well and I think that I can provide a really good point of view for my stakeholders of each question. I hope that the professors could see my efforts for this project / assignment. I'm really giving my all to make this the perfect assignment for this unit."
2020-05-11T01:29:31.109897,dubgum43,50,group-3,"Week 9 I started out - or so I thought - at the start of this assessment making regular reflections. I thought I had a great plan, a great approach and I was on track. ..Well, that was until I actually took a breather to look more closely at the requriements of the task itself. So not to worry. If I spend too much time at this point placing too much importance on the content of what does and doesn't need to be included in this component (the reflections) of this part of the assessment, I may find I will get behind on my entries all together and put myself in a total and unnecessary spot of bother. So please forgive me if these entries are way off the mark. I have really liked the idea behind them and think they would provide students a safe, anonymous space that can be helpful. A place that free thought can be chucked down and a platform for tackling some of the stress that comes from travelling through the learning processes. It is a platform that has been critical my own life to help me travel through it. A means to alleviate stress. So it's not so much that it's foreign, but more that it takes away some elements that have made it enjoyable (like purchasing a fun-covered notebook or just allowing one's thoughts to completely veer off track and that being ok). While this particular format intorduces further elements that, coincidentally, bring things back to the same questions raised - particularly with the mental health topic - such as trust, confidentiality and also keeping on task throughout the data analysis process, addressing the quality of the data - how this felt difficult in the mental health.. So the plan is to make up for a bit of some of these things in this week ahead with a few entries, rather than just the one"
2020-05-11T01:57:49.598185,dubgum43,51,group-3,"Week 10 (Monday) So launching off from that last point, before I come back to even discussing the quality of the data or analysis itself  - the very nature of this process itself - electronic journal writing - in terms of capturing and measuring emotional states, progression, etc to capture  and perhaps aid individuals in this way sounds quite useful and helpful if it is conducted and used in the right way to the right audiences but this reverberates the things very same things that were raised throughout the analysis process itself. Particularly with the mental health topic. Knowing what to do with the data and what was done with the data felt like two different things and came about travelling along a bumpy road full of more questions than answers - and even though this was part of the process that had to occur - it also felt back to front and led to feeling not enough trust in the data to want to carry on with any further analysis, even if I could. it was quite clear why these processes need to be repeated and why it is so important to properly plan and delve into a level of questioning process before even tackling the analysis - if its possible - and with what I tried to achieve I felt like I no longer wanted to draw any conclusions even if I had to draw things out. Dealing with qualitative data, my learning process with the content, the processes and that overarching question. It began to grow a bit hairy in the wrong ways for me. So I have decided to use this platform to discuss these things in more detail as it will actually help me to tie together the learning that I experienced throughout the course of the analysis process and the actual 'journal' assessment itself. Forgive me for my free thought, repeating myself and whatever else."
2020-05-11T10:47:30.957974,zofdox34,54,group-3,"Before this week's tutorial (week 9), I have no idea where should I start and how I will plan this assignment, I think this is very hard to breakthrough. Even I watched the video that Andrew went through the assignment hand out and criteria, it was easy when I just listened to him. Once I have to analyse about that by myself I feel my head is blank. For me, this week's lecturer content is an extension of week 8 that describes the reasons why we have to focus on the ethics of providing information or explaining data because sometimes AI provides bias results or some time it can't differentiate between the breed of dog and wolf. These results can have both positive and negative impacts on people's life. This might be something that can ruin someone's life If the results from AI came out with sever negative results. For example, people with darker skin tend to be criminal person than a white person. All of the information Andrew has brought this week provides me with a bird view in what direction I will explain my data and how data analytic has an impact on decision making. At the end of the session, Andrew gave us an opportunity to ask some questions and this helps me improve the ideas of critiquing my work. For Tutorial, Patrick gave us the opportunity to talk and exchange information with him and classmates. In which we discussed trust or ethics by dividing the topics into 3  topics, trust in Data Collection, Data itself and Analytic. We also discussed PMI which is used to analyst the positive side/ pluses(P), negative side/ minuses(M) and interesting side (I). This helps me shape my report and direct me where should I start the report."

As of now, I can basically understand the technologies and theories designed in the course, and I can use these technologies. But when I want to expand something new, I often have no way to start. It is hard for me to find suitable functions in a library or find another appropriate library for a certain purpose. Usually I will choose to look for some similar example online to learn, so although I can learn things, obviously I can only learn  very incomplete content. I am very puzzled about how to learn a library, and whether it is necessary to study the library comprehensively. After all, under normal circumstances, we only need to use some functions in a library."

Data Analytics is how much you ask yourself what you are doing with the data provided, from the data provided if you ask where it came from, where it came from analyzing how the data was placed when placing the data perceive and ask yourself who made it and why. Data Analytics goes far beyond writing code that provides answers to our questions but adding questions about the dataset we are using to receive such answers. Having this analytical side when manipulating data is essential to mitigate some problems that we may have, such as misleading visualizations, algorithm bias, answers bias, among others. This article made us think about what we can improve in relation to the data analyst, what we have to think about and rethink in relation to data analysis, to question whether it is possible to obtain specific and error-free answers just by answering the initial question."

It helped me with my point of view, to critique each idea, critique everything that is happening around me in life as well as for analytics. I expected more coding, more understanding of code as well as the aspect of decision making but it was not aimed at the subject.  The bad thing that happened after the mid-term break was separating students into two groups. it made the subject more complicated and also a bit gave me the feeling that you are not good enough! one side was the feeling that is okay you don't have to do more of you don't like but also it had kind of feeling that is telling you there are a lot of people are doing better than you as if you are studying every day even more than some of them.  I like to join all of Catarina's interaction sessions but I was related to advanced group and it was also kind of double working and I did not have time. However,  the whole team were working so hard as I compare to my other subjects that they just provided us with the recorded videos from the last year and did not do as much as 619 teams did, I would say that was too much, I could not follow the lectures, could not follow workshops."

I still have a lot of work to do to get to the end of this semester which is only 2 weeks away, but I know I can do it. It has definitely been a tumultuous ride and I have had a lot of personal issues come up during this semester. But this time last year I lost my mum and I go through a Master's level finance subject and got a 6 GPA. I know what I am made of and I have the heart of a lion right now. I am doing this foremost for myself but I also want a better life for my family. This assignment is an insight report which is teaching me to critically analyse my work. I love that I get do this. The technical aspects of the assignment was very difficult for me but I soldered on. I felt confident in answering my insight for Q1 so have decided to use that for Assignment 2.

How can I learn from other perspectives in future? What do I plan to do about it? In which direction do I head next?  This week marks the completion of Module1. In this week's lecture, Catarina showed us how to perform a full data analytics cycle by using Corona Virus as an example. While trying my best to absorb as much as information and knowledge as I can, I find 'Python folium' fascinating yet challenging at the same time. The geographical visualisations generated by using python folium is so powerful however I am still struggling to follow the codes used in the lecture notebook. I realised that the python language is even more powerful than I though it is and there are so much for me to learn. A friend of mine personally knows a few great data analyst and he mentioned that he can introduce me to them in the future. I think it would be a great opportunity if I can get to know some data analysts and pick their brains. "

2020-05-14T12:57:18.527216,mocfam21,51,group-3,"I was struggling about whether to suspend this semester or not because of the covid-19 and eventually decided to keep going but forgot to keep writing the reflection journal so I start it today. In the first 3 weeks, the coding part was quite tricky for me since I didn't learn Python before. The coding part is the most challenging part of the assignment 1B for me. Slack helped me a lot. When I encountered some problems, I could first check if the others had asked the same coding problems by searching with keywords. If there was no solution in Slack, I could just simply ask by starting a thread. Tutors and classmates were so responsive and most of the problems could quickly be solved. After I finished the assignment 1B, I felt confident with Python. Another main challenge of assignment 1B was the interpretation of the question. I was interested in questions 1 and 3 so I chose those. However, I didn't quite understand what is 'national conversation' in question 3. I tried to google its definition but still felt vagued. I saw some of the classmates reported the same doubt on Slack. After reading the response of tutors, I started having some sense of it. I chose to use a dataset of topics of Reddit to represent the national conversation. The concepts of this unit are easy to understand for me. I think to tell a good story from the data is important for a successful data analysis. It is not about using very fancy ways to manipulate the data but an appropriate way that is the best fit to tell the story. I think it worth spending time thinking about 'what is the story' before starting data mining. The most interesting part of week 9 is the ethical concern about using machine learning. I thought machine learning was a very powerful tool and I didn't realize that it can produce some moral problem. Because we don't know the hidden layer of machine learning, it becomes a black box that it may judge something for a wrong reason despite the fact that it is accurate. I think to deal with this problem, the use of machine learning should be limited in an appropriate problem space. Also, the development of explainable ai can help solve this problem."

2020-05-18T00:58:13.289700,rixcit20,70,group-3,"I once assumed that the workings behind my personal assistant Amazon’s ‘Alexa’ was out of this world - almost ‘superhuman’ -  and would often wonder how the device is able to respond to some questions after saying the word ‘Alexa’. However, considering the insights from recent lectures and tutorials which prompted more research on Machine Learning and Explainable AI, I was able to understand the importance of machines learning from experience. For me, not only did I learn that Machine Learning algorithms required an increased number of training samples to gain insights, improve performance and make better decisions, but one of the most significant aspects was that a change of background setting could influence the decision of the Machine Learning algorithm as seen in the example of the wrong choice of the Husky over the Wolf, even with very high accuracy. This knowledge is essential to me as a learner because I had not previously considered the process of training and retraining to achieve the level of accuracies required. Because I am still not confident about the technical aspects of the Machine learning algorithm this will give me an opportunity to dig a bit deeper into the workings behind the theories for future use.

2020-05-18T08:54:58.133650,dubgum43,58,group-3,"Week 11 (Monday) The fundamental backbone of data analysis is query-based decision making. But not the programming kind, nor the leadership or project variety. Some of the collection of questions will definitely include concentrate at times on these areas, but they won't encompass all the variety of questions a data analyst might be faced with while processing the data or considering the problem space. Either way philosophical appreciation is no guarantee that a person can apply the principles in a meaningful or useful way - or come out feeling they have managed to even answer the question in the first place. I certainly experienced all of this and in part it was one of the reasons why I rejected one problem space over the other. In spite of being able to waffle on easily at times it become quite unhelpful for me at ties. For this reason I actually prefer to deal with clearer targets or black and white problems (particularly under certain circumstances - like work-based ones) . Partly because I can become easily distracted or easily overwhelmed and partly because time had to be factored in - as to whether I could even manage to produce something that not just meaningful but felt the data quality wasn't compromised. I did feel quite torn. From a personal position the ideas that came out of the mental health problems space raised a multitude of further questions, subjects for discussion - such as those raised within the lecture material. Trust in the data itself, confidentiality, ethical practice, disclosure and reliability with the data itself. The nature that the data was obtained, obtaining permission to find out more about the survey and how it was constructed. Whether the sample size had any relevance outside a single global company/department. Also topics getting into the way in which the data could even be classified as a survey. It was closer to a psychometric questionaire. And these alone can pose problems with the data being reliable before it has even been passed through any of the analysis process. For example - whether candidates are even being truthful, open honest when they answer, even if asked to. Attitudes and trust with whom has issued the test can alter this type of outcome - how comfortable an employee might feel when they know it has come from their employer. Or whether they would even want to take this kind of questionaire. And one other problem it raised was the fact that cultural, mood and personal perceptions can also affect the 'strength' of a response.  But my strongest concern, by far was processing the data that I felt was already of bad quality and needed more research and supplementary information (that would possibly be hard to come by, given the confidential nature of it) to make more of the data. Consideration of looking at the data based on age and age brackets or with a greater focus across US states was thought about. But ultimately my own self stepped in the way and blocked me from viewing the problem as merely an example - an exercise in data analysis - to try out technique and skills and explore the data lightly - rather than worry over how I might corrupt the data further. I simply didn't like messing with the qualitative data. By the time I tried to draw out some meaning from it I, myself, no longer trusted it. At this point I had to make tracks on to the next question and I felt that I needed a great deal more time to turn the Mental Health data around to shift it into ordinal data. It's nominal state was another off-putting factor. I needed to cap this part of my analysis and move on the the second question in the assessment for part B. However, having said this - as an exercise to gain experience in my own spare time i would actually like to start with qualitative data - like the mental health question and to further experiment with it as a starting point to develop my confidence in exploring data that is categorical and nominal. Why? because I think -for the very reasons (but not limited to) as already stated, I felt it could provide me with some natural technical developmental exercises that could have a positive affect. One that's twofold - lower my fear of handling qualitative data - and encourage me to keep it up - and also exercise my analyst skills in a way that lends itself to making more improvements with decision making processes, and is perhaps more experimental or creative. So perhaps the issue of feeling safe in working with the dataset itself was a growing factor for me. Combining time constraints and trusting my own abilities to work with the qualitative data further  and also failing to see it as simply an exercise in processing the data led me to reject travelling further with it. The Housing market data on the other hand felt clearer, more reliable to work with for this reason and I felt I could trust that it captured a sensible representation of a population for a given problem space. Despite lacking the specialist platform of knowledge in how it would be used to by the government to make decisions to help govern the economy. In addition, the fact that it was relevant as an Australian citizen also provided interest. "
2020-05-18T09:13:18.174283,dubgum43,54,group-3,"Reflecting on my learning through the analysis to date: During the course of the learning experiences that emerged from the data analysis I formed a paragraph that I felt captured the essence of why it is so important that analysis needs to be cyclical. I kept it for a later stage thinking it might be useful down the track. So I've chosen to include it here to tie in with my reflective learning gained from the analysis (and going forth with it)..... Analysing information that is readily available through the world wide web is an essential skill to have for todays data analyst. Part of the solution and research phases, in solving a particular business concern, may require the extraction of current and publicly available information found online. It might be used to help shape the direction of the research itself, or reveal a need to obtain further data. Either way, being able to translate and wrangle the freely sourced data to draw more meaning from it is a way that allows business to formulate research that is not only comparative and current but rather extracted in real-time. However, the very nature of utilising data in this way raises some important issues relating to risk, ethical practice or further decision making launched from inadequate analysis itself, for example. Consequently, this amplified one of the reasons why the analysis process must be cyclical. Each phase needs to be revisited. The method of extracting and utilising online data needs to be matched with analysis that processes the data for its suitability, quality and relevance to the problem space. This needs to begin in the exploration and extraction phase and carry right through to the final formation of any final documentation, where the visualisations of the data provide meaningful communication to the audience needing to read it.

2020-05-18T15:21:48.977562,fastiv47,63,group-3,"This week I reviewed the advanced data analysis techniques used in lecture and tutorial after the week 7, such as LDA, Neural Networks, SVMs and so on. Although I can understand the principle of the course content, I can also read the code, understand its structure and the setting of key parameters, and do simple analysis of the results. But because of the half-knowledge of the core theories of these technologies, it is difficult for me to use these technologies freely when facing a whole new set of data. Due to lack of relevant knowledge of Statistics and Mathematics, I encountered many difficulties in learning the theory of technology. I wonder if it is enough for an ordinary data analyst to only understand the concept of this knowledge and can set key parameters?Or it is enough to open the door of the career of data analysis. Of course, in the future work, I still need to master these theories through practice and learning. For me who graduated immediately, I really do not have more time to study these technical theories in depth now."

2020-05-19T09:59:18.177367,cuzdus72,58,group-3,"I found the first assignment a huge difficulty, I struggled in a number of ways, finding and sorting data I found a huge struggle, getting python to do what I wanted it to do, navigating sources like stackoverflow for clues as to what I could do. The problem I had was, we were told we weren't going to be marked on our code and that we could just take code from wherever we found it, which originally sounded like a good idea to me, however, what I was lacking was the basic understandings of even what to look for when it came to the coding, I couldn't find the code I needed because I did have the appropriate language to even start  looking.  I found the questions, purposely, vague and difficult to interpret, I struggled for a long while in just breaking down what it was that the questions were asking for. I also struggled to provide much clarity in a lot of areas, I feel like I was grasping at straws in points in order to make any sort of point. However, I will say that the assignment force me to grow a lot very quickly, my coding grew very quickly and also intrepretation skills, its hard to know for certain on that second one whether my intrepretation skills have improved or whether I just got very familiar with the questions that I saw that much more clearly by the end. But the assignment gave me a lot more confidence in both areas, I was even proud of some pieces of that assignment.  "
2020-05-19T10:14:59.244616,cuzdus72,53,group-3,"The talk that Andrew was giving on the ethical responsibilities of data analytics is very interesting, I said in my previous entry that at time I felt that I was grasping at straws to produce results, and my first thought is that I worry that similar things happen with people under the pump to produce something for their boss or company, and they are grasping at straws and come out with something that is maybe not only useless but as Andrew pointed out, a lot of the time it can be harmful. I wonder what safeguards are put in place in order to protect data analytics from being a danger to those sorts of time pressures. It's all well and good to say that the analyst should have the ethics to hold firm, but under threat of losing their job, it is a lot to ask of a person, and it is the companies that need to have the safeguards there to protect their employees from feeling that pressure.  Obviously COVID is the backdrop to all of the information that I am receiving currently so it is difficult not to draw comparisons, even tenously. I was thinking a lot about the Government App that tracks people's movements and that isn't a data analytics function per say but it is raising intresting questions about what is private and what is public, and what people need to offer up to the community for the communities protection, and what right does a community have to demand private information from someone, ie their location. An app that tracks your movement is seem by many as a huge infringement on their privacy, and they are being, blackmailed might be too strong a word, into acquiescing to the terms and conditions for the 'Greater Good'. Similar questions could be asked of data analytics programs, where does usefulness and privacy intersect, at what point does somethings use overwrite people's privacy. Just has me thinking. The predicitions of repeat offenders, for me, highlighted the serious issue with the data that the analysis was built on,data reflective, maybe, of the police situation in the united states. It seems, corrupt people, make corrupt data, and corrupt data, makes corrupt projections. With that in mind, what is the solution, do you abstain from data projection until you have a cleaner data set. Would a job hiring projection more strongly advocate for Male Ceos because the current data shows a higher number of male ceos. It seems to me that the model isn't racist, that data behind it is racist, collected by racist institutions, but can racist data be used to set right injustices, what would that look like, could a model attempt to curb that stigma. My inital thoughts are doubtful, but something to think about.  "

On a more positive note, I have been doing my absolute best and my results have been proof that hard work pays off. I got another 7 for my other unit. I am doing well in this unit also, GPA 6 but I could see where I needed to correct my issues to be able to do well in the upcoming assignment.

The thing is I come from a finance background stayed away from the finance related Q in Assignment 1 as I wanted to challenge myself. Well, I definitely did that with the mental health question, but all in all it was good to get out of my comfort zone and give it a go.

First of all, this unit is different from other units, it has different teaching methods, and there is no ppt learning content, lecture is also divided into sections. Feelings: For me, there are some new feelings. In addition, regarding the Jupyter notebook tools that need to be used, because of little contact with python, I was in a dilemma when installing the environment. Challenge: Since this is a new type of unit, it needs to be followed with daily practice. Due to a lack of data processing experience, the previous course will be more difficult, and because of the epidemic, I am still stuck in China and cannot attend the course, Therefore, there are certain challenges in classroom interaction. This will cause some trouble for my early and middle-term studies. Self-criticism: During this week I did not understand all the content as expected. Laziness made me simply listen to the recording and had a basic understanding of this unit, but did not prepare for the following study. Potential solution: Set your own plan for the next study and the effect you need to achieve. Think hard and communicate with your tutor or classmate when you encounter difficulties. Learning opportunities: For this week's learning content, I have a general understanding of the technology I need to use. I will deepen the practice in the next time and try to consolidate the relevant learning work of data processing."

Feeling: I learned the API, text structure, and visual content of web page data this week. Because I have a part of the front-end learning experience before, I can absorb this chapter well. Challenge: However, the difficulty lies in the collection of data. After I wrote the code, it did not work as expected, so I checked the information to see if it was due to a problem with the Python version or without the installation of the library. To be honest, there is a certain sense of loss when the written code does not run as expected. Self-criticism: So I left the problem for a period of time, and I still did not have the attitude to solve the problem in a timely manner. In the case of difficulties that have not been resolved, I will relax for a while and wait for the next time when I will use this part of the content. Content, but the difficulties are still not effectively resolved.

The first challenge came from the huge data set, how to handle millions of data sets and obtain useful information from them. With thinking about the problem, I expect to find an effective solution in the lecture. From Andrew's tutorial, I found two types of text processing models IDF / IDA. They can propose the most frequently used vocabulary from the original data set and import it into the model to divide specific topics. However, I also have the same troubles as the instructor, which is also a model for analyzing text. Which one will have better results? Then I used Google to search for related research and documents and finally chose to use LDA as the training model because it has the ability to understand human language, which can help us or the final result.

Regarding question 2, through the previous learning and cognition, I did not write it directly after I got the question, but I did an analysis first. How does the social economy affect the housing price index in different regions? I did research on this and found that two important indicators, the socio-economic index and house price indexes in different regions, are important influencing factors. Therefore, I found the original data set from Fred and integrated the indicators of 5 different cities in the United States for analysis. The challenge for me is that this is the first time I have left the tutorial. Although I used the analysis steps in the tutorial, I still need later feedback to update my knowledge. however. The process of writing a notebook has given me a new understanding of this unit. How to analyze the original problem and help the decision-maker to draw conclusions is always the core."

Module three is the application of more specific machine learning algorithms. Therefore, the learning of this module carries a look forward to it. In the eighth week, the lecturer explained the StreamA process for us. The important parts are data selection and analysis of the limitations of the analysis results. What impressed me is one of the examples. The prediction of future criminal behavior caused a bias in sample selection when training the model. Therefore, it was concluded that black people have a higher crime rate than white people. The stability of is biased, so we need to think more when choosing a data set, and think after the model training is completed. Which kind of prediction behavior is it more suitable for? Whether the prediction will be biased due to under-fitting or over-fitting. Through these thinking, I have more solid thinking about the problem, which is also helpful for me to make decisions in the future."
2020-06-01T08:19:19.053703,cimpol87,63,group-3,"The practical part of Module 3 was learned this week. It mainly proposed two advanced machine learning text classification models, and my main focus was on the Naive Bayes classifier because this model is more representative and My interests are related. From Abudul's tutorial, I followed his ideas and read the text topic classifier. It uses Sklearn's python library and trains the original data. Finally, the 20 topics that have been discussed the most are analyzed. After studying this part, I thought about whether it can be applied to the streamB of my assignment2 because they all have similarities. However, when I practiced, I encountered a lot of challenges. There are millions of data. A lot of content cannot be completely included in the library given by the model, so I continue to look for solutions. The enlightenment given to me by this model lies in the unsupervised learning mode. First, the keywords of the data set are extracted, and then classified into the corresponding models one by one, and the results are finally generated. I am eager to learn and hope to find better solutions in the later study."

2019-03-16T12:38:19.144208,hovrab95,48,group-3,"Preparatory task 1c seemed more difficult than the first two tasks. The lecture for week 2 helped regarding how to identify claims, qualifiers, support and warrants. But in reality, it was quite difficult identifying claims as sometimes the authors have more than one claim or they don't structure the sentence well so it does not even seem like a claim. Being able to understand this was very crucial for my task 1c especially for the literature review. I am definitely unable to identify the argumentation style but I can say I am progressing quite well in trying to decipher the claims and aims of various research work that I have come across in the journey of my literature review. Another area I am struggling with is the amount of reading materials that we have to read weekly. When combined with the other units and expectations from the school, it seems like an impossible task to accomplish but I hope to master the art of skimming through soon as it would be helpful in my literature review. Overall, though am still struggling with my research problem (and until I am clear on my scope and problem it will be difficult progressing) and probably need to request for a 'meet' with my tutor, I could say I have now mastered the art of advanced database searching, the various techniques - phrase searching, nested searching, the use of Boolean operators, truncation symbols and applications and the use of the available QUT database."

But harshitha said li8 teesko antha ekkuva aalochinchaku annadi. So I guess I am normally reacting. Even ammu is back on whats app and chatting too, thats better actually.

But that is just an insecurity of mine. people doesn't become friends based on compatibility right? So I think I can pull this thing off as a close good friend. Basically, I too have so many stories to tell in my life, Its just that I care less and dont remember to express those to others. Idhee vishyam nenu annayaki kuda cheppa, about how I had so many stories but not that expressive to tell them. In my life, things are never as planned, every day there are so many stunts, I am pulling off to survive the day. All these stunts are stories for me.

I back talked that it is the worst thing to do with Ammu and did it anyway. Though there are certain fears like the color  of the privates might not be as appealing to an oustsider. also I had a skin allergy. But anyways, After I went, she was already prepared for it. Though she doesn't look same as she was in her profile pictures. Thats the greatest disappointment. She was completely revealing and it is not a good start. It should have been a bit covered so that something is left for imagination which can turn me on. No kissing is also a major flaw. All I did is just for curiosity and I feel like I need to stop this and start chasing real things.  "

So I hate myself that I depend on her very much to share my feelings and all. Life was not bad before ammu. But after meeting her I had a girl bestie, someone to talk, a girl who cares about me. It was an overwhelming experience. But the point is I am just another guy in her life. For me there are any women so she played a very very big role in my life.

2019-03-18T04:17:13.115996,hovrab95,56,group-3,"Assessing my progress over the past 3 weeks on this unit, I would say that the various preparatory tasks are important and is helping me towards understanding research unit. There are now certain areas which I no longer struggle with like literature review search, searching using various databases, how to identify trustworthy publications by observing the number of citations, confirming if it has been peer-reviewed, verifying my source, using advanced search techniques like Boolean operators, etc.As I progress with the various task activities, reading up on my literature and discussing with my tutor, though my topic has changed severally, I am now learning how to define the focus of my problem. However, my literature review results seem to be returning similar articles as I progress with my search which is one challenge I have experienced in the course of executing week 3 preparatory task."

2019-09-02T11:11:04.010762,kigmab91,59,group-3,Preparatory Task 2A: This task helped us create a set of workable research questions. The questions needed to be unique and significant. Much of the time spent was brainstorming different aspects of the research problem. I found this quite simple. I looked at the introduction of Assignment 1 for key concepts and then did a corresponding literature search. This would be a litmus test for 'significance' of research questions. 
2019-03-23T00:52:20.786775,cegbug66,4,group-3,"Now I am brainstorming to exact research topics. Also, reviewing for lectures."
2019-03-23T14:07:41.571942,hovrab95,60,group-3,"The main core of a research statement as I am beginning to understand is the ability to argumentatively present an unbiased view of a problem area and not merely reporting what was said by other people. I have learnt that the development of my search strategy is one of the key requirements to achieve this goal and is an iterative act, whereby the initial search term used isn't the one I end up with in the final search output as it gets refined over time. The final output being the literature review is what is really needed for the tasks and that is the area I found difficult as there are a lot of materials to read. Despite applying the reading techniques taught in class about how to identify claims, warrants and supports, when there are a lot of materials to review in very little time, this becomes very tedious. Also, as rightly stated by the tutors, further research into my problem area has led to a continuous review of my research topic hence my research problem has evolved as more insight is gained from my research articles."

2019-04-03T01:33:42.061684,jiblab93,57,group-3,Thinking of how to frame research questions
2019-04-05T02:34:50.475581,hovrab95,76,group-3,"I feel it has been a great journey so far with so many learning points with some challenges along the way. I have always enjoyed reading. However, I found myself inwardly questioning that especially with the amount of materials I have had to read or skim through within the past 5 weeks. I would think that my initial confusion with the unit outcome played a part in that feeling of disengagement that I felt during the first week. This feeling however improved as we embarked on each preparatory task. Discussing the tasks during the weekly tutorials is definitely a good way to get students involved and it helped me. The tutorials provided a good forum for me to learn (both from the experienced tutor and from fellow students). My key take-home from the tasks we did was in understanding the links between each tasks and the ultimate roadmap. Some skills developed are use of the Boolean operators, search strategies, looking out for trustworthy publications and identifying cited articles. I need to acquire more skills on skimming and scanning strategy as this would help my reading for future tasks. As I re-examine my feelings these past weeks, I realised that struggled with defining the boundaries/unit of analysis of my problem statement and identifying novelty. However, from my observations during discussions, I identified that critical thinking is a required skilled during a research process. By asking critical questions as to who and why, and looking for gaps, my research domain got refined. This was a major learning point for me – the importance of defining boundaries. Without doing that, my literature search would have been overwhelming and I would have been lost in so much unnecessary literature. This was indeed the case at the start of my research. A major skill I picked up was the development of themes. In my next research task, I believe it will be quite value-adding not to jump straight into the task but to think first about a strategy. I would develop a mind-map, identify my themes, and thereafter use that to guide my literature search process. Another key skill was the need to track my literature which always made it easy to refer to them when needed. I found the logging of my literature to be very helpful as it ensured I kept track of all my literature sources from year of publication to their URLs – like a literature search catalogue. I do need to acquire more skills in how to synthesize my literature as this would aid in my literature review.I felt tutorial classes to be very important and more time to be devoted to them. Some improvements I would like to see in the tutorials are the creation of a balance between what we learn in theory and how it can be applied practically using examples. I feel this would improve my learning process. I would also recommend drop-in sessions be made available for students especially during assignment periods.  I also felt the wooclap exercise was very engaging and provided a safe medium for me to voice my opinion or challenge without feeling judged.  This approach could be adopted for the tutorial classes. I have definitely increased my critical thinking skills and organization skills as these are key tools for any researchers. Other key skills I need to strongly develop that would be helpful for future tasks include: 	Ability to synthesize information and be articulate  	Ability to link my ideas together when writing, especially across sentences and paragraphs.  	Art of concise writing 	Ability to identify and remove redundancies in my writing 	Literature reading skills for research 	Literature review methodologies "
2020-09-07T13:35:30.269363,honcid93,5,group-3,"I would like to start new subjects. To be honest, it was stressful. It is because I don't understand what I need to do. I also don't know what is content analysis before. I don't understand what is content analysis. My mental and physical health play big parts to my proposal. I misunderstood what is content analysis because I think the content analysis is the way to analyse text and theme by using NCapture and Nvivo. My topic is about social media, so I think I need to collect data from social media. In fact, I just need to find the structure to find a relevant article to find a theme. Thank to the consulting section and problem resolution to help me clear our mind to change direction. Hopefully, I can get a high score in this subject. I expect 7."
