# GoingOK Interactive Visualisations
This project has the Typescript for the UMD library used to display the authors and administrators dashboards in the [GoingOK](http://goingok.org/) software for reflective writing.

This project has unit tests with Jest and allows an automatic processing of reflective phrases for authors if this is not provided by the database.
