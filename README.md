# GoingOK Interactive Visualisations
This project has the Typescript for the UMD library used to display the authors and administrators dashboards in the [GoingOK](http://goingok.org/) software for reflective writing.

This project has unit tests with Jest and allows an automatic processing of reflective phrases for authors if this is not provided by the database.

Within the project, there is a demo showing how the dashboards are going to look like and the interactions that the dashboards provide to users. Each dashboard has a control (little to no interactions) and experimental (completely interactive) versions. Each experimental version can be visited here:
- [Administrator interactive dashboard](https://maciiv.github.io/goingok-interactive-visualisations/demo/adminexp)
- [Author interactive dashboard](https://maciiv.github.io/goingok-interactive-visualisations/demo/authorexp)
